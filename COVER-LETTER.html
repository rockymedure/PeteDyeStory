<p>Hi Seth,</p>
<p>Thank you for sending over the manuscript and for all the work you’ve
put into this project so far. The interviews you captured are wonderful,
and it’s clear you connected with our family and the staff in a
meaningful way.</p>
<p>After reviewing the manuscript, we wanted to share some additional
thoughts to help guide the next phase.</p>
<p>The pulled quotes and family stories are beautiful—and they’ll
absolutely be part of the final piece. But we want to make sure we’re
aligned on the vision: <strong>this is meant to be a documentary, not a
family archival video.</strong></p>
<p>The story of Pete Dye Golf Club has elements that resonate far beyond
our family. It’s about an 18-year journey against the odds. It’s about
Pete Dye—one of golf’s greatest architects—putting his name on a single
course, and choosing an abandoned coal mine in West Virginia to do it.
It’s about immigrant heritage, working-class values, and what happens
when determination meets vision.</p>
<p>We see this as a film with broader appeal—something that could reach
golf audiences, West Virginia audiences, and anyone who loves an
underdog story. We’re also exploring potential sponsorship and
distribution opportunities, which means the narrative needs to land with
viewers who don’t already know our family.</p>
<p>To that end, I’ve put together a story outline that I’d love for you
to review. I used AI to read through every single Substack post we’ve
written—from day one until now—about the Pete Dye story. The outline
that follows is what came out of that process: a distillation of 29
posts worth of history, stories, and details into a narrative arc for
the film.</p>
<p>It’s not a script—it’s a guide to the emotional arc and key moments
we think the film should build toward. The three-act structure, the
themes, and the handful of anchor moments we’ve highlighted are what we
believe will make this resonate. I hope it’s helpful.</p>
<p>Your footage is stunning, and the interviews are a treasure. We just
want to make sure the final film tells a story that’s as compelling to
strangers as it is to us.</p>
<p>Let’s find a time to talk through this together. We’re excited about
where this can go.</p>
<p>Warmly,<br />
Natalie</p>
