<p>Pete Dye designed over 100 legendary golf courses. He put his name on
one. Carved from an abandoned coal mine in West Virginia, alongside two
miners who spent 18 years refusing to quit. This is the story of
why.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-story-in-one-page">THE STORY IN ONE PAGE</h2>
<p>This is a story about perseverance, partnership, and pride.</p>
<p><strong>James D. LaRosa</strong> was the son of Italian immigrants
who came to work the coal mines of north-central West Virginia. His
grandparents met at Cooks Mine in 1913—on the very land where the golf
course now sits. James D. worked the mines himself before building a
successful business. He had a dream: to give something back to his
community by building a golf course.</p>
<p><strong>Pete Dye</strong> was the most influential golf course
architect of his generation—the man behind TPC Sawgrass, Whistling
Straits, and the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island. When James D. and his
son Jimmy first showed Pete a different piece of land, Pete rejected it:
<em>“Call it Miracle Mountain—because it’ll be a miracle if anyone comes
to play it.”</em></p>
<p>But when they showed him the abandoned strip mine—scarred, rusted,
overlooked—Pete saw something no one else could see. He disappeared into
the timber with a bundle of flags and emerged two hours later having
already routed 18 holes in his head. He would design over 100 courses in
his career. This is the only one he ever named after himself.</p>
<p>What followed was an <strong>18-year journey</strong> that tested
everyone involved. Ice storms. Financial crises. Skeptics who said it
would never happen. Pete’s relentless perfectionism. Through it all, the
LaRosa family and their team refused to quit.</p>
<p>On <strong>July 4, 1995</strong>, the Pete Dye Golf Club opened to
the world. Pete rang a bell installed on the 12th hole in memory of his
father. After 18 years, 18 holes were finally complete.</p>
<p>The club went on to earn national recognition—ranked among the best
courses in America, hosting state championships and the PGA Nationwide
Tour, attracting members from 27 states and 5 countries.</p>
<p>But this isn’t just a golf story. It’s a story about <strong>West
Virginia</strong>—its coal heritage, its immigrant roots, its
working-class values, and what happens when determination meets
vision.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="key-emotional-moments">KEY EMOTIONAL MOMENTS</h2>
<p>These are the scenes worth building toward—the emotional anchors of
the film:</p>
<h3 id="pete-names-the-club-late-1980s">1. Pete Names the Club (Late
1980s)</h3>
<p>On the 6th fairway, after years of debating names, Pete asks Jimmy:
<em>“Do we have a name yet?”</em> Jimmy says no. Pete: <em>“The hell
with it. Let’s call it Pete Dye.”</em> A handshake. Then: <em>“I want
you to know this will be the only club named after me.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is when Pete stakes his legacy
on this project. Of 100+ courses, he chose this one.</p>
<h3 id="the-bell-on-12-july-4-1995">2. The Bell on #12 (July 4,
1995)</h3>
<p>A bell was installed on the 12th hole in memory of Pete’s father—the
man who built Pete’s first nine holes. On Grand Opening morning, Pete
sees it for the first time and rings it. The emotion is visible. The
bell remains there today.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is the emotional climax. The
father-son thread runs through the whole story—James D. and Jimmy, Pete
and his father.</p>
<h3 id="opening-day-july-4-1993-or-1995">3. Opening Day (July 4, 1993 or
1995)</h3>
<p>After 15-18 years of work, the course is finally real. Standing on
the first tee with family. Bagpipes. Fireworks. The dream made
tangible.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The payoff moment. Everything they
endured was for this.</p>
