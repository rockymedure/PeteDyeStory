## THE STORY IN ONE PAGE

This is a story about perseverance, partnership, and pride.

**James D. LaRosa** was the son of an Italian immigrant who came to work the coal mines of north-central West Virginia. James D. worked the mines himself before building a successful business. He had a dream: to give something back to his community by building a golf course.

**Pete Dye** was the most influential golf course architect of his generation—the man behind TPC Sawgrass, Whistling Straits, and dozens of other legendary courses. When James D. and his son Jimmy showed Pete the land in West Virginia, it was Pete who saw potential in an abandoned strip mine that others would have dismissed. He committed to the project. He would go on to design over 100 courses in his career. This is the only one he ever named after himself.

What followed was an **18-year journey** that tested everyone involved. Ice storms. Financial struggles. Skeptics who said it would never happen. Pete's relentless perfectionism. Through it all, the LaRosa family and their team refused to quit.

On **July 4, 1995**, the Pete Dye Golf Club opened to the world. Governors, celebrities, and golf legends gathered to celebrate. Pete rang a bell installed on the 12th hole in memory of his father. After 18 years, 18 holes were finally complete.

The club went on to earn national recognition—ranked among the best courses in America, hosting the PGA Nationwide Tour, and attracting members from 27 states and 5 countries.

But this isn't just a golf story. It's a story about **West Virginia**—its coal heritage, its working-class values, and what happens when determination meets vision. It's about the people who built something lasting in a place the rest of the world overlooked.
