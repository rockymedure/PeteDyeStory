## LOGLINE

Pete Dye designed over 100 legendary golf courses. He put his name on one. Carved from an abandoned coal mine in West Virginia, alongside two miners who spent 18 years refusing to quit. This is the story of why.

---

## THE STORY IN ONE PAGE

This is a story about perseverance, partnership, and pride.

**James D. LaRosa** was the son of Italian immigrants who came to work the coal mines of north-central West Virginia. His grandfather James LaRosa Sr. met his grandmother Emilia Cava at Cooks Mine in 1913—on the very land where the golf course now sits. James D. worked the mines himself before building a successful business. He had a dream: to give something back to his community by building a golf course.

**Pete Dye** was the most influential golf course architect of his generation—the man behind TPC Sawgrass, Whistling Straits, and the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island. When James D. and his son Jimmy first showed Pete a different piece of land, Pete rejected it outright: *"You don't need me to build an average golf course on an average piece of land in central West Virginia. Call it Miracle Mountain—because it'll be a miracle if anyone comes to play it."*

But when they showed him the abandoned strip mine—scarred, rusted, overlooked—Pete saw something no one else could see. He disappeared into the timber with a bundle of flags and emerged two hours later having already routed 18 holes in his head. He would go on to design over 100 courses in his career. This is the only one he ever named after himself.

What followed was an **18-year journey** that tested everyone involved. Ice storms. Financial crises (including a million-dollar loan that was approved, reversed, then reinstated by a letter). Skeptics who said it would never happen. Pete's relentless perfectionism. James D. moving 10 days worth of dirt on the 18th hole—only for Pete to return and make him move it all back. Through it all, the LaRosa family and their team refused to quit.

On **July 4, 1995**, the Pete Dye Golf Club opened to the world. Governors, Joe DiMaggio, and golf legends gathered to celebrate. Pete rang a bell installed on the 12th hole in memory of his father—the man who built his first nine holes. After 18 years, 18 holes were finally complete.

The club went on to earn national recognition—ranked among the best courses in America, hosting state championships and the PGA Nationwide Tour, and attracting 474 members from 27 states and 5 countries.

But this isn't just a golf story. It's a story about **West Virginia**—its coal heritage, its immigrant roots, its working-class values, and what happens when determination meets vision. It's about a family whose grandparents met in a coal camp on this very land, and who turned those scarred hills into something the world would travel to see.

**The Setup:** Introduce the LaRosa family heritage, Pete Dye, and the improbable partnership they formed over land everyone else overlooked.

#### Scene 1: The Land Before the Links
- **250 years of history** — Native American artifacts (arrowheads, pottery) found on holes #1, #2, #5, #10
- **The coal era** — The Pinnikinnick Mine, Cooks Mine, the tipple on #10, the working-class community

- **The Italian Heritage Festival** — The family's connection to community; James D. on the board, dignitaries like Joe DiMaggio attending
- **The golf dream** — Wanting to give back to West Virginia

#### Scene 3: Pete Dye Enters
- **The first site (rejected)** — Pete, James D., Jimmy, and Mike Krak explore a different property; get trapped in an old railroad tunnel as a freight train thunders past; Pete declares: *"Call it Miracle Mountain—because it'll be a miracle if anyone comes to play it."*
- **The coal mine site** — Two months later, Pete returns; sees the abandoned strip mine with its iron-stained creek, rusting machinery, and scarred ridges

#### Scene 4: The Partnership Forms
- **Gary Player contract** — Jimmy, just in his mid-20s, has to tell golf legend Gary Player they're going with Pete instead; Gary's gracious response

- **Land acquisition** — From 250 acres to 1,300+ acres to protect the course's integrity
- **Pete's visits begin** — Nightly phone calls, frequent site visits, the creative partnership deepens

**Tone:** Aspirational, nostalgic, setting up the underdog story

---

### ACT II: THE STRUGGLE (12-15 min)

**The Journey:** Show the decade-plus of obstacles, the relationships that formed, the moments of humor and heart, and what it took to keep going.

#### Scene 5: The Hard Years (Early-Mid 1980s)
- **The economy** — Two recessions, Reaganomics, oil collapse, near-foreclosure three times
- **Joe DiMaggio enters** — Introduced through James D.'s college roommate Bernard Folio; Joe's favorite architect was Pete Dye; becomes a regular visitor and supporter
- **The shapers arrive** — P.B. Dye, Lee Schmidt, Tom Doak, Keith Sparkman, Mike Langkau; fresh from shaping the Ocean Course, Teeth of the Dog, Whistling Straits
- **Hand-built course** — Nearly every bunker shaped by hand; Pete and his shapers speaking shorthand only they understood

#### Scene 6: Close Calls and Setbacks
- **Black damp** — James D. enters a mine shaft without ventilation while shaping #13; collapses from oxygen-depleted air; unconscious for 10 minutes before being pulled out. Most miners never survived.
- **The bridge fire** — A massive wooden bridge from the coal era, near #10 tee, catches fire from a welder's torch; burns to the ground while they watch helplessly
- **The oaks on #2** — James D. begs Pete to save the massive oak trees lining the fairway. Pete humors him: *"We'll leave them until I get back."* The next morning: smoke rises from #2. The trees are gone. Years later, #2 is ranked among the top 500 golf holes in the world.
- **Pete's design fee** — Pete hands Jimmy a newspaper about Jack Nicklaus charging the first million-dollar fee. As he leaves, Pete says he needs "a little money." Jimmy nervously checks account balances. Pete laughs: *"I just need a couple hundred dollars to get back to Florida!"*

#### Scene 7: The Course Takes Shape (Late 1980s)
- **Naming the club** — On the 6th fairway, after years of debating names ("The Coal Club," "Burning Embers," Scottish options), Pete asks: *"Do we have a name yet?"* Jimmy says no. Pete: *"The hell with it. Let's call it Pete Dye."* A handshake. Then: *"I want you to know this will be the only club named after me."*
- **Alice Dye's influence** — Her first site visit; pushes for forward tees; turns to Jimmy: *"Do you have plans for this to be a men's club?"* Then to Pete: *"Pete, if this is designed to be a men's club, you won't finish the course."* Pete: *"Ok, Allie."*
- **The 18th hole debacle** — With Pete away, James D. moves 10 days worth of dirt to relocate the green closer to the clubhouse. Pete returns: *"Jim, what in the hell did you do?"* James D. moves it all back. The 18th golfers play today is Pete's hole.

#### Scene 8: Enter the Team (Early 1990s)
- **Gary Grandstaff** — Pete's trusted superintendent; called at 4 a.m. about a "crazy Italian friend" building a course in coal country; arrives in 1989, never leaves, tends the course for 30 years
- **Dick Psolla** — Agronomist; builds 2+ miles of backup water line to the West Fork River
- **The green miracle** — After years of brown dirt, bentgrass finally spreads across the front nine; the first living color in decades

#### Scene 9: The Final Push (1992-1993)
- **The Ryder Cup moment** — 1991, "War by the Shore" at Kiawah; Pete and Alice invite Jimmy inside the ropes; crowds chanting *"Pete Dye! Pete Dye!"*; Jimmy realizes carrying Pete's name means carrying responsibility
- **Louie and Nancy Ellis** — Family friends filming since 1978; 20 years of documentation; at the end of each session: *"No charge—Louie signing off."* Without them, much of this history would be lost.
- **The Storm of the Century** — 1993 brings 30 inches of snow in December, then another two feet in March; the back nine is delayed; front nine will open alone
- **Senator Randolph's stones** — Foundation stones from the Senator's Salem home are preserved and become the steps to the #1 tee
