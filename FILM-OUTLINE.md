## LOGLINE

Pete Dye designed over 100 legendary golf courses. He put his name on one. Carved from an abandoned coal mine in West Virginia, alongside two miners who spent 18 years refusing to quit. This is the story of why.

## THE STORY IN ONE PAGE

This is a story about perseverance, partnership, and pride.

**James D. LaRosa** was the son of Italian immigrants who came to work the coal mines of north-central West Virginia. His grandparents met at Cooks Mine in 1913—on the very land where the golf course now sits. James D. worked the mines himself before building a successful business. He had a dream: to give something back to his community by building a golf course.

**Pete Dye** was the most influential golf course architect of his generation—the man behind TPC Sawgrass, Whistling Straits, and the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island. When James D. and his son Jimmy first showed Pete a different piece of land, Pete rejected it: *"Call it Miracle Mountain—because it'll be a miracle if anyone comes to play it."*

But when they showed him the abandoned strip mine—scarred, rusted, overlooked—Pete saw something no one else could see. He disappeared into the timber with a bundle of flags and emerged two hours later having already routed 18 holes in his head. He would design over 100 courses in his career. This is the only one he ever named after himself.

What followed was an **18-year journey** that tested everyone involved. Ice storms. Financial crises. Skeptics who said it would never happen. Pete's relentless perfectionism. Through it all, the LaRosa family and their team refused to quit.

On **July 4, 1995**, the Pete Dye Golf Club opened to the world. Pete rang a bell installed on the 12th hole in memory of his father. After 18 years, 18 holes were finally complete.

The club went on to earn national recognition—ranked among the best courses in America, hosting state championships and the PGA Nationwide Tour, attracting members from 27 states and 5 countries.

But this isn't just a golf story. It's a story about **West Virginia**—its coal heritage, its immigrant roots, its working-class values, and what happens when determination meets vision.

## THREE-ACT STRUCTURE

### ACT I: THE DREAM (8-10 min)

**Setup:** Introduce the LaRosa family heritage, Pete Dye, and the improbable partnership they formed.

- The LaRosa immigrant story—coal miners who built a life in West Virginia
- Pete Dye at the height of his career—legendary architect, known for impossible projects
- The rejected first site vs. the abandoned strip mine Pete chose instead
- Pete's commitment: *"If you give me total freedom, this could be one of the finest inland courses in the country."*

**Tone:** Aspirational, nostalgic, underdog setup

---

### ACT II: THE STRUGGLE (10-15 min)

**Journey:** The years of obstacles, the relationships that formed, and what it took to keep going.

- The long road—18 years of setbacks, weather, financial pressure, skeptics
- Pete's perfectionism and the creative partnership with James D.
- The team that formed—superintendent, pros, staff who became family
- Near-misses and close calls that would have stopped most people

**Tone:** Gritty, determined, moments of humor and camaraderie

---

### ACT III: THE ARRIVAL (10-15 min)

**Payoff:** The opening, national recognition, and the legacy that followed.

- July 4, 1995—the Grand Opening celebration after 18 years
- National recognition—Links Magazine, Golf Digest, USGA rankings
- The traditions that took root—tournaments, members, community
- What it means to West Virginia and to the next generation

**Tone:** Triumphant, emotional, reflective

---

## KEY EMOTIONAL MOMENTS

These are the scenes worth building toward—the emotional anchors of the film:

### 1. Pete Names the Club (Late 1980s)
On the 6th fairway, after years of debating names, Pete asks Jimmy: *"Do we have a name yet?"* Jimmy says no. Pete: *"The hell with it. Let's call it Pete Dye."* A handshake. Then: *"I want you to know this will be the only club named after me."*

**Why it matters:** This is when Pete stakes his legacy on this project. Of 100+ courses, he chose this one.

### 2. The Bell on #12 (July 4, 1995)
A bell was installed on the 12th hole in memory of Pete's father—the man who built Pete's first nine holes. On Grand Opening morning, Pete sees it for the first time and rings it. The emotion is visible. The bell remains there today.

**Why it matters:** This is the emotional climax. The father-son thread runs through the whole story—James D. and Jimmy, Pete and his father.

### 3. Opening Day (July 4, 1993 or 1995)
After 15-18 years of work, the course is finally real. Standing on the first tee with family. Bagpipes. Fireworks. The dream made tangible.

**Why it matters:** The payoff moment. Everything they endured was for this.
