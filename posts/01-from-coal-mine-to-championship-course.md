Welcome to the journey and many thanks for joining in.

This is the unlikely story of how two lifelong coal miners partnered with one of the greatest golf courses designers in the world, Pete Dye, to build a course on the very land they once mined.

This is a story that spans more than 250 years. From Indigenous peoples and early settlers to immigrants, coal miners, and, eventually, golfers. At the heart of this land's long and layered history stands the Pete Dye Golf Club, a course born from coal, carved by vision, and shaped by time.

It was the land itself that first called to Pete Dye. On his very first site visit, the topography, the natural amphitheaters, Simpson Creek, the quiet entrance road, and the scars of abandoned coal mines all stirred something in him. He began imagining the routing of the course that very day. Not with formal plans, but by walking the land and listening to it. To witness his mind at work was to witness something extraordinary.

This land's timeline traces all the way back to 1763. We've documented its story through interviews, photographs, videos, articles, and podcasts. Over time, I'll share all of it here.

But today, I want to fast forward, to 1993 through 1996, the years when Pete's vision took form, and the course first opened its doors. The recognition, the awards, the rankings — they are all a testament to the land, Pete's genius, the coal heritage, the community, our incredible staff, and the commitment from everyone who poured themselves into this place.

This is the beginning. The rest is forth coming.
