## The Pre-Dye Era

Long before Pete Dye placed a single stake into West Virginia soil, the hills outside Bridgeport held stories that ran even deeper than the coal seams below them. The timeline of this land, stretching from disputed colonial frontiers to immigrant-built coal camps, sets the stage for everything that would follow.

Here's the capsule timeline of how 1,000 rugged acres waited, almost impatiently, for what would become their final act of the Pete Dye Golf Club.

### 1763: A Contested Frontier

By the mid-1700s, Britain and France were still sparring for territory as six Iroquois nations, plus the Shawnee and Delaware, fought to keep their ancestral grounds.

Arrowheads and pottery shards later unearthed along what are now holes #1, #2, #5, and #10 prove these ridges were prime hunting and fishing grounds long before a golf ball ever rolled on the land.

### 1726–1772: Patents, Pioneers, and Simpson Creek

- **1726:** Colonel Morgan receives a crown patent for 1,000 acres, including part of the course
- John Simpson—frontiersman, trader, and the creek's eventual namesake, settles at its headwaters. The stream you'll see snake through 1½ miles of the course still bears his name.
- **1772:** Aaron Smith buys 400 acres fronting what is now the entrance road and front nine. His twelve children populate the region, establish Smith Chapel (still greeting members at our gate), and fill a hillside cemetery just beyond #2 tee. A century later his families refusal to sell "so the children could grow up in the country" unintentionally preserved the land for a golf course yet to be imagined.

### 1800s: Coal Fever and an Onrush of Immigrants

As the new republic industrialized, coal seams in Harrison County ignited an economic gold rush. By the early 1800s roughly 70 mines dotted the region, pulling families from Italy, Ireland, Poland, and beyond.

Cooks Mine, tucked behind today's #5 green, drew the first LaRosas / Cavas to the property and seeded the family lore that would one day bring Pete Dye calling.

### Late 1800s–Early 1900s: Big Coal Stakes Its Claim

Clarksburg Fuel Company opens the Pinnikinnick Mine in Glen Elk.

- **1903:** Consolidated Coal buys the operation. Their subterranean tunnels stretch three miles, surfacing behind future hole #10.
- **1913:** At Cooks Mine, James LaRosa meets Emilia Cava. They marry, cementing the bond between coal and the family who will later commission a world-class golf course on these very scarred hillsides.

### 1965–Early 1970s: Strip Mines, Tipples, and a Brush with Disaster

Fresa Construction purchases ~250 acres of surface rights and begins strip and deep mining along what will become holes #1, #10, #11, and #12.

The tipple you can still spot near #10 fairway once loaded countless railcars of coal from those operations.

Local legend recalls a roof fall in the deep mine right of today's #11 fairway. Three workers were buried; two clawed out. After three, rescuers hand-shoveled 1,500 feet to find the third miner alive, surviving on nothing but an apple and a pack of gum. All rescuers earned the Carnegie Medal for Heroism.

### 1977: Stillness Before Greatness

By the late '70s strip-mining slowed, profits plateaued, and 250 acres of gouged ridges sat silent, save for Simpson Creek still winding through narrow, iron-stained banks.

That's exactly how my father and I first showed it to Pete Dye. But that introduction, and the creative jolt it sparked, belongs to next Sunday's chapter.

## Why This History Matters

When golfers talk about "course architecture," they usually point to green contours and bunker shapes. Yet every ounce of soil lifted in 1978 moved more than dirt; it displaced centuries of frontier skirmishes, immigrant sweat, and coal-camp camaraderie. Understanding that lineage lets you see each fairway not just as playable ground but as a living timeline, one you're literally walking across with every round.

So lace up for next week: we'll move from land lore to design lore, chronicling the improbable handshake that turned a spent strip mine into one of America's most celebrated 18 holes of golf.

*See you next Sunday.*
