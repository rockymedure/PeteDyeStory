# From Mine Cut to Masterpiece: Pete Dye's First Site Walk

*How a chance visit, a stalled dream, and an abandoned coal mine sparked one of America's greatest inland courses.*

In the early 1970's, my father and I were certain we'd found our golf-course site. Four miles from where the Pete Dye Golf Club now sits, a rolling tract seemed perfect for the community we were planning. We even had architects lined up: two designers from Gary Player's new firm, recruited through our friend Mike Krak, PGA Tour pro and longtime head professional at Wee Burn and John's Island.

Then curiosity, and a phone call, changed everything.

## A Frank Assessment

Because Mike also knew Pete Dye, we invited the game's most inventive architect to give a second opinion. Pete met Dad, Mike, and I and set off through the hills about 4 miles from where the Pete Dye Golf Course exists today. After a muddy trek that included getting pinned inside an old railroad tunnel while the 4-o'clock freight thundered past (an ordeal that bonded us for decades), he delivered his verdict—one we still quote verbatim:

> "You don't need me to build an average golf course on an average piece of land in central West Virginia. And if you do build it, you ought to call it Miracle Mountain—because it'll be a miracle if anyone comes to play it."

It stung, but it sharpened our vision. If we were going to spend serious money, we owed it to ourselves, and to West Virginia, to aim higher.

## Back to the Maps

Pete left us with a mental checklist: natural amphitheaters, dramatic elevation changes, water that could be woven into play, and, most of all, land that told a story.

Dad and I rummaged through topo maps and memories until one parcel tugged at us: an abandoned strip and deep mine site we barely owned a sliver of. Raw, weather-beaten, dotted with tailings and rusting machinery, yet full of promise.

We called Pete. Would he look at one more property?

Two months later he was back in West Virginia.

## From Rough Ground to Rough Draft

The entry "road" was little more than a rutted trail, yet Pete leaned out the window and remarked that it could become a beautiful drive. At the future clubhouse site our colleague Bob Andrews joined us, and the five of us set off on foot. We didn't even own most of what we were walking, but that didn't slow Pete. After three hours he asked for a bundle of marking flags and disappeared alone into the timber.

Two hours later he returned, mud-spattered and grinning. He had already roughed out eighteen holes in his mind with nothing but the flags in hand. If we would give him total freedom (no condos, no compromises) he told us that he believed the property could host one of the finest inland courses in the country.

## Making Mining History A Part of Golf History

We pointed out the site's blemishes to Pete: iron-orange mine drainage, derelict equipment, a half-collapsed drift opening, the coal tipple squatting where the 10th fairway might run.

Pete surprised us by insisting that these reminders of West Virginia's coal heritage should stay. Rather than hide them, he wanted to weave them into the narrative of the course, turning the layout into a living museum of the land's past.

## A Handshake and The Beginning

Timelines? We'd sort them out. Fees? Pete waved them off for the moment; what mattered more was momentum. None of us were in a rush, but all of us felt the spark. Standing in that forgotten hollow, we shook hands and agreed to move forward, even though we still owned only a fraction of the acreage.

And so the journey began. Over the next three decades that conviction carried us through land deals, engineering puzzles, environmental reclamation, and an education in Dye-style creativity that was nothing short of mesmerizing.

But it all started the day Pete walked a coal-pocked hillside, planted flags, and saw greatness where others saw ruin.
