Ice storms, delays, and the million dollar miracle that kept the Pete Dye Golf Club dream alive.

## Article Content

I recently shared how we celebrated Opening Day of the front nine. That first unforgettable moment when a dream fifteen years in the making finally touched the real world. But as we all know now, that wasn't the finish line. In many ways, it was only the beginning.

Because while the front nine was open for play, the entire back side of the course, 10 through 18, still existed only in various stages of completion. And just as we hit our stride, the harshest winter in years rolled across the area.

What followed was a season of delays, improvisation, grit, and a few miracles (both big and small) that pushed the Pete Dye Golf Club one step closer to becoming whole.

### The Deep Freeze

The winter of '93–'94 came in hard. Ice storms and record-low temperatures swept across the area bringing all construction to a halt. For nearly two months, progress froze. Equipment sat buried under ice. The ground itself felt immovable.

When the thaw finally came, so did the reality: *the back nine opening would be pushed into late summer.*

But slowing down wasn't an option. As soon as the freeze lifted, the team jumped back in, more determined than ever.

That same spring, construction began on an eight-bedroom lodge for members and guests. True to the chaos of the timeline, the lodge was completed on the very same day the back nine finally opened.

### The Race to Reopen

After losing sixty days, the push became frantic. Extra manpower. Extra equipment. Longer days. Whatever it took.

We even began sodding areas originally meant to be seeded. An expensive pivot, but one that helped guarantee we could still open.

Then there was the lake on #15.

It leaked.

We drained it, repaired it, refilled it.

It leaked again.

Meanwhile, bunker sand ran short and another wash plant had to be brought in just to finish the job. By late May, after meeting with Pete and Gary, I made the call: *we would open the back nine on October 1st.*

### Building the Team

Amid all the construction chaos, something equally important was happening behind the scenes: the formation of the leadership team that would guide the club into its next chapter.

In late '93, during a visit to The Honors Course as Pete's guest, I met Bill Stines, their golf professional. Bill and I quickly forged a connection and it soon became clear that he was a perfect fit for what we were building.

He'd always wanted to help shape a club from its earliest stages. To have his influence felt in its DNA.

With the blessing of Mr. Lupton, owner of The Honors Course (and Pete's full endorsement) Bill joined us in early 1994 as Head Golf Professional. Around the same time, Jim Jamieson became our Director of Golf.

### Membership on the Move

Even with only nine holes open, momentum kept building.

Our early members became our best ambassadors, opening doors throughout the Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, Billy, relentless as always, began strengthening relationships he had started back in 1992 when we had nothing more than a small booth in the basement of the Peabody Hotel at the PGA Show.

His hard work paid off. Coverage began to appear in:
- *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* (Marino Parasenzo)
- Cleveland Plain Dealer (George Sweda)
- Famous Photography (Alan Satterwite)
- *Washington Golf Monthly*
- *Sports Illustrated* (Hymie Diaz)

On top of that, our photographer Brian Morgan spread the story through his travels—even taking Billy inside the ropes at The Masters for four days as his photo assistant.

At the same time, I was working Florida, connecting with golfers from Pittsburgh, Columbus, and Virginia who wintered there, using Pete's reputation to help shine a light on what we were building in the Hills of West Virginia.

### The Million-Dollar Ask

By early Spring, cost overruns were hitting from every direction: new tees Pete requested, double repairs on #15, purchases of additional acreage, and rising supply prices. Funds were running low. Again.

The largest remaining expense was the irrigation system.

Pete, understanding the urgency, called his friend Jack Lupton, the billionaire/philanthropist owner of The Honors Course. A meeting was arranged at Seminole. I asked that Bill join me and Pete gave us two instructions:

1. Wear a sports coat.
2. Keep it short.

I was in my early 30s, nervous beyond words, and preparing to ask a man I didn't know for a **one-million-dollar loan**.

I spoke for about ten minutes. When I finished, Mr. Lupton looked at me and asked: *"are you about finished?"*

My stomach dropped. I asked for two more minutes. He nodded.

To my shock, he said *yes*.

He understood what we were building, felt comfortable with me during our brief meeting, trusted Pete and Bill's confidence in me, and approved the loan. Bill and I walked out stunned, then headed straight to Duffy's for several celebratory beers.

But the story didn't end there.

Within days, materials were ordered and installation began, even while the legal paperwork was still being finalized. Two weeks later, I received a call from Mr. Lupton's CFO, Dave Gonsenbach:

Mr. Lupton had changed his mind due to the complexity of the paperwork, which his team wasn't accustomed to.

He would *not* be funding the loan and his decisions were final.

It was a gut punch.

But we weren't done.

That night, we wrote a heartfelt letter explaining the stakes. A few days later, Dave called again.

*"I don't know what you put in that letter,"* he said, *"but Mr. Lupton reversed his decision. He's never done that before."*

The loan was reinstated. The irrigation system was completed.

And one year later, the loan was repaid.

### "Bury Me in a Pot Bunker"

As we approached the back nine opening, national attention kept growing. Even with only the front nine open, author Mark Shaw released his book *Bury Me in a Pot Bunker* and dedicated an entire chapter to the Pete Dye Golf Club.

The timing was perfect. The book introduced our coal-mined hillside turned championship course to a national audience *just* as excitement around the project was peaking.

### Progress At Last

By the time the frost melted and the last irrigation lines were buried, we were exhausted but moving again. Proof that even the harshest setbacks can be overcome with persistence, luck, and a few well-timed miracles.

The back nine was in sight. Membership was growing. National attention was rising. And for the first time, the full story of the course was beginning to come together.
