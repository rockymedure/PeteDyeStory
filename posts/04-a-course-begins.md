*A contract ended, a vision ignited, and a new chapter in golf course design began.*

We'd already inked a deal with the Kirby–Player Design Group for the original site. But after meeting Pete Dye and seeing the property he'd fallen in love with, there was no going back. First order of business: end the contract, gracefully.

That's how my dad, James D., and I found ourselves headed to Charlotte for a dinner meeting with Mr. Kirby, unaware of the surprise guest waiting at the table. As we turned the corner, there he was, Gary Player himself!

I was in my mid-20s, about to tell one of golf's living legends that we were taking a different direction with our project. My Dad was in awe and nearly rendered speechless in the presence of Mr. Player - and quickly looked to me to take the lead. There was only one way forward, brutal honesty. I laid it out: the change of plans, the new site, the chance to work with Pete Dye. For a moment, silence. Then Gary leaned in.

> "Jimmy, I understand your dilemma, and I can't say that I blame you," he said. "We're early in our design business, and now you've got the most famous designer in the game willing to build a course on a different property. I can't fault you for that."

The tension dissolved instantly. Dad rejoined the conversation, the air clear. Soon, Gary suggested we cover their expenses to date, and they would void the agreement, an incredibly gracious gesture. After a few lighthearted critiques of my golf swing, we shook hands and parted ways.

## Building Pete's Vision

With the path cleared, we began assembling the land. Pete had identified about 250 acres necessary for the course. However, as he talked about the backdrops surrounding the course, it became evident that we needed to acquire that property as well. When finished, we had acquired approximately 1,300 more acres to protect the courses integrity. Around this time, Pete began to make more frequent site visits.

We talked at length about how to integrate the land's mining history: the restoration of Simpson Creek and how to manage deforestation and reclamation. At the time, Simpson Creek had narrowed to just 10–15 yards in some areas, choked with debris, sediment, and iron-laden mine water. It was, to say the least, very unattractive.

Pete insisted it be addressed early. He began staking fairway widths, tee boxes, greens, and, most importantly, the drainage system that would pull water from more than 1,000 surrounding acres into Simpson Creek, keeping the course playable during wet weather.

Pete didn't design on paper. He had us stake a landing area 260 yards from a proposed tee, then hit balls and shape the hole outward from there. Hazards, bunkers, and tree lines only appeared after he saw how the ball moved through the land.

The fairways were generous, meant to welcome golfers of all skill levels into the beauty and tranquility of the hills.

The initial tree cuts were easy. The debates about trees would last for years.

## The "Crazy Italian Hillbilly Coal Miner"

At the time, I was still deeply involved in the mining business, so we put our friend and coworker, Bob Andrews, in charge of the project. But it became clear early on who was truly steering the ship: my dad, James D.

Pete took to him right away, even giving him a nickname that stuck: **"The Crazy Italian Hillbilly Coal Miner."**

The two grew into unlikely creative partners. My father's passion for moving dirt was matched only by his determination to make the course better than even Pete imagined. Pete came to respect the effort and pride Dad poured into every detail. In time, Dad became a kind of co-designer, not just executing Pete's vision but pushing to enhance it. Sometimes he was successful. Sometimes not!

Finally, we moved our full crew and equipment onto the site. I was personally able to begin to spend more time there, and that's when the real stories began.
