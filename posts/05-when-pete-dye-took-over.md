*Inside the years when Pete's vision deepened, Dad's ideas pushed boundaries and fairways began to emerge from coal country.*

By the early 1980s, activity on the course was in full swing. Pete began visiting more frequently, and it wasn't unusual for my dad or I to be on the phone with him almost every night, giving updates or taking instructions for the days ahead.

Soon he sent in one of his most trusted lieutenants: Max Robertson. Max had worked with Pete through multiple projects over the course of nearly 15 years. He became our on-site superintendent. He understood Pete's rhythm, he understood us, and he blended perfectly with our motley crew.

With Max handling day-to-day operations, Dad suddenly had a little extra time on his hands. What did he do with it? He started studying architecture books by Alister MacKenzie and Donald Ross so he could "assist Pete any way possible." That was my dad in a nutshell.

## "Do You Want to Own the Whole County?"

During this period we kept buying up more land to protect the course. At one point Pete asked Dad, half-joking:

> "Jim, do you want to own all the land in the county?"
> 
> Dad shot back: "Only what's next to us!"

We laughed, then got back to work.

## On the Road with Pete

Pete also began taking me on the road. He wanted me to see features from other courses he had just completed or was still building: Old Marsh in Palm Beach, the TPC Stadium Course at Sawgrass, PGA West in La Quinta, Oak Tree in Oklahoma, the Honors Course in Tennessee and the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island, later host of the 1991 Ryder Cup.

Many of these he had been commissioned as brutally difficult tests of golf. The press nicknamed him "Penal Pete." When a journalist asked him about it at PGA West, Pete just grinned and said:

> "I don't know… but if you want a tee time, you'll have to wait a year. You tell me."

That was vintage Pete.

## A Course of Our Own

Back home, I started to see how Pete's philosophy was taking shape on our site. He wanted a course that golfers of all skill levels could enjoy — extremely wide fairways, multiple grass lines, and only minimal use of railroad ties.

Pete often floated ideas casually, not really expecting us to act on them. But Dad took them as marching orders. A mine passage connecting holes 6 and 7, the dramatic high wall and bunker on #8, the waterfall fed by mine water on #10, all sprang from Pete's offhand comments, brought to life by Dad's ingenuity and our crew's capabilities.

Sometimes, the ideas had to be reined in. At one point we considered a tee location across Simpson Creek on #5, until we realized a cemetery sat perched above it. Pete shut that down fast.

## Two Decisions, One Fire

Two sticking points slowed progress: a small house near the 7th green, and the massive oaks lining the left side of #2 fairway.

For months we tried to salvage the house, charmed by its character. Finally, Pete gave his verdict:

> "Tear it down before I get back."

We did and it was the right call.

The oaks on #2 were harder. Dad loved them and begged Pete to keep them, envisioning a tree-lined fairway. Pete, knowing Dad's passion, humored him: "We'll leave them until I get back."

The next morning, we arrived to find smoke rising from the direction of #2. The trees were gone. Dad was sick to his stomach, stopping work until he could talk to Pete, fearing a terrible mistake.

Pete's explanation was simple:

> "Jim, I had to get it done sooner rather than later."

History proved him right. A few years later, #2 was ranked among the top 500 golf holes in the world.
