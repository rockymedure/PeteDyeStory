*A story of coal, community and celebration in honor of the 46th Annual Italian Heritage Festival.*

This week marks the 46th annual Italian Heritage Festival in Clarksburg, a tradition that has filled these hills in WV with music, food, and community for nearly half a century. For my family, it's more than just a festival, it's a reminder of a story that began with two Italian immigrants, a coal mine, and a legacy that would one day include the Pete Dye Golf Club.

The very ground beneath the Club rests on the Pittsburgh coal seam. In the early 1900s, the Pinnikinick mine opened near Glen Elk. Its operations stretched across what is now the Club's property, providing work for hundreds of immigrants, among them, my grandparents. It was in that mining camp that my grandfather, James LaRosa Sr., met my grandmother, Emilia Cava, one of seven siblings. They married, built a life here, and chose to stay in America. Had my grandfather returned to Italy, as he once considered, our family's story (and the story of this golf course) would have been entirely different.

In 1979, the first Italian Heritage Festival was held. My father, James D. LaRosa, served on the board of directors. To him, it was not just a celebration for Italians, but a celebration of the opportunities America had given his parents and their generation. It honored the hard work, sacrifice, and community spirit that shaped this region.

The festival grew into one of the largest in the country, drawing nearly 100,000 visitors at its peak. Friends came from Florida, Boston, Chicago, and beyond. Dignitaries like Joe DiMaggio, Senator Joe Manchin, John Calipari, Angelo Dundee, Rollie Massimino, Hot Rod Hundley, and many others attended. And many of Dad's friends, most of them golfers, made the short trip to see the course we were building. Their visits, their enthusiasm, and the stories they carried home all helped spread the word about what was happening in West Virginia. In that way, the festival became an unlikely ambassador for the Pete Dye Golf Club.

This year, I want to give a special shout-out to the festival's honorees: Italian Woman of the Year, Sarah Brunetti Aman, and Honorary Italian Man of the Year, Ed Aman. Ed was my guest at our very first Member-Guest tournament at the Pete Dye Golf Club and more than three decades later, he and Sarah are still members. We also share two grandchildren together.

As we celebrate the festival's 46th year, I'm reminded that the Club's story isn't only about golf or design. It's about coal and community, immigrants and opportunity, and the spirit of celebration that carried us forward. For that, I'm grateful — and I hope this weekend, amid the music and food, we all take a moment to honor those who came before us.
