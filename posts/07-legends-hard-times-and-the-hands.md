*How a Yankee legend, Pete's shapers, and a few hard laughs helped carry us through some of the hardest years.*

## Joe DiMaggio and the Club

In the early 1980s, my father's college roommate and close friend, Bernard Folio, introduced us to Joe DiMaggio. Mr. DiMaggio had first come to the area for the Italian Heritage Festival, and in the years that followed he became a regular visitor, both to the Festival and to our course.

Joe was an avid golfer, and his favorite architect happened to be Pete Dye. A camaraderie developed among us that lasted more than a decade. As Joe watched the course take shape, he grew more invested in Pete's vision, sharing the story with friends in his circle.

Traveling with him was unforgettable. Together we visited several great courses, most memorably three trips to Casa de Campo's Teeth of the Dog. Walking through La Romana alongside Pete and Joe was something to behold. The townspeople credited Pete for developing the local economy through his course, and of course, Joe was Joe. The respect for both men was palpable.

We also played the Blue Monster at Doral, Seminole, and eventually our own Pete Dye Golf Club. Joe even helped Pete test shots as holes came alive, and he attended both our unofficial opening in 1993 and our official opening in 1994. He also opened doors I could never have opened alone.

Thank you, Mr. DiMaggio.

## The Economy

The 1980s were a turbulent time to build a golf course, certainly not for the faint of heart. The late '70s and early '80s brought deep recession, high inflation, and a collapse in the energy markets. Commercial and residential real estate, ventures we were also tied up in, fell hard.

Two recessions, Reaganomics, deregulation, and soaring interest rates in the late '80s — and it's safe to say this was not ideal timing. Pete's courses, while extraordinary, were also known for exceeding budgets. His designs were never inexpensive to build.

The project was refinanced multiple times through the 1980s, and on at least three occasions it came close to foreclosure. But we pushed forward. Pete himself even introduced me to friends who quietly helped us navigate those financial challenges.

They were very, very difficult times.

## Here Come the Shapers

As construction progressed, Pete began sending in his most talented shapers, the craftsmen who fine-tuned his vision into reality. The first was his son, P.B. Dye, already a designer in his own right. Soon after came Lee Schmidt, Tom Doak, Keith Sparkman, and Mike Langkau.

These men had just come from shaping some of the finest courses in the world — the Ocean Course, the Honors Course, Teeth of the Dog, Blackwolf Run, Whistling Straits. To have this much talent concentrated on one project was unusual, and we knew how lucky we were. Lee Schmidt went on to work for Nicklaus Design Group and of course Tom Doak designed Brandon Dunes among others. Even Jackie Nicklaus who played in several Member Guests offered some insight as well.

Much of our course was hand-built, not machine-built. Nearly every bunker was shaped by hand; a scoop of sand here, a bucket of dirt there, a shovel of topsoil to finish. Pete and his shapers spoke a kind of shorthand language only they understood, and it was something to behold.

To this day, Pete Dye aficionados tell me they can see touches of those other courses woven into ours.

## Pete's Design Fee

One morning in the early '80s, Pete stopped by our construction trailer for coffee. He handed me the newspaper and asked me to read aloud an article: Jack Nicklaus had just charged the first-ever million-dollar design fee.

"What do you think?" Pete asked.

"Well," I said, "I guess Jack just set the new standard."

Pete raised his eyebrows. "That's a lot of money for a design."

Naturally, I assumed the conversation was about to turn to Pete's own fee and with the economy the way it was, my stomach sank a little.

As he was leaving that day, Pete said, "Jimmy, I'm going to need a little money."

Thinking he meant the design fee, I said carefully, "Pete, it might take a few days. I'll need to check account balances."

He started laughing. "I just need a couple hundred dollars to get back to Florida!"

We laughed all the way to the airport.
