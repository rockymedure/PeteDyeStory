# Close Calls, New Faces, and a Course Taking Shape

*From black damp to burning bridges, Joe Hardy to bunker sand — the mid-'80s shaped more than just the course.*

By 1985, the land was finally beginning to look like a golf course. Pete's fairways were taking shape, and we even began hosting a few walking tours for friends. Not everyone believed we would finish, but each site visit (especially when Pete himself was there) added to the lore.

The progress became more real by the day, but so were the dangers.

While shaping #13, a dozer collapsed into the roof of an old mine shaft. My dad went in to inspect and forgot the miner's golden rule: never enter without ventilation. The shaft was filled with black damp, air stripped of oxygen. He collapsed almost instantly. The operator pulled him out, but he was unconscious for ten minutes before coming around. By the time the ambulance arrived, he was breathing again. Most miners never survived such a thing. We were fortunate.

As the course grew, so did the visitors. One of them was Joe Hardy, the cigar-smoking, larger-than-life owner of Nemacolin Resort. I had gotten to know Joe through the years over scotches and a few Cubans. Our conversations often drifted to Pete and the course. I invited him to see the course one day and before long I was driving Pete up to Nemacolin to meet him. Pete initially pushed Joe to build his course at a lower elevation, but Joe was famously persuasive. Against his own instincts, Pete agreed.

Mystic Rock was born: a course that would later host PGA events.

The mid-'80s also brought heartbreak.

Near #10 tee stood a massive wooden bridge built in the coal era. Trucks once hauled loads from the tipple across the bridge, down what is now #1 fairway, past the cemetery, and onto Meadowbrook Road. We had hoped to preserve it, but sparks from a welder's torch caught fire, and within minutes the entire span was gone. We could only stand and watch as a piece of history burned to the ground.

At the same time, a practical problem loomed: bunker sand.

Shipping it in would mean barging to Parkersburg and then trucking to the site, costs that were astronomical. We looked for alternatives and found a deposit on a farm near Shinnston, West Virginia. On its own, it wasn't up to spec, but lab tests showed that with washing and processing it could work. Pete approved. We bought a wash plant, set it up near the lake at #15, and began producing our own sand. It was unusual, but it saved a fortune. We also experimented using black coal cinders instead of sand but abandoned that idea rather quickly!

The years from 1985 to 1988 were full of setbacks, close calls, and hard-won solutions. But slowly, against the odds, the course was taking shape.
