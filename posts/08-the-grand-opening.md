At last, The Weekend had arrived.

After eighteen years of planning, shaping, waiting, adjusting, and believing, it was our Grand Opening weekend. All hands were on board. Every member of the team was fully invested. This was our opportunity. Not just to open a golf course, but to show who we were and what this place stood for.

When I woke up that morning, the overwhelming feeling wasn't nerves. It was relief. Relief in knowing we were ready.

Saturday evening's dinner and festivities set the tone for everything that followed. A 3,000-square-foot tent had been erected above the 10th tee, complete with flooring and chandeliers. Elegant, welcoming, and perched right on the course itself. The weather was spectacular. The kind of summer evening you hope for but never assume you'll get.

The night before, there was a rare quiet moment. Pete and Alice, Leigh and I sat down to dinner together and taste-tested the cuisine for the following day. After years of construction meetings, site walks, and problem-solving, this felt different. Calmer. Reflective. Four people sharing a table on the eve of something that had taken nearly two decades to arrive.

Early the next morning, we gathered the staff for our weekly meeting to go over last-minute details. Pete was already out on the course with Gary. Knowing Pete was walking the property that morning, seeing the finished holes, taking it all in, always created a sense of accomplishment. It felt like a quiet affirmation that we had reached the point we'd been working toward for so long.

As the day wore on and guests began to arrive, our team performed flawlessly. And somewhere along the way, the focus shifted. It became less about opening the course and more about the experience we were creating.

That, to me, was success.

After playing nine holes with Joe DiMaggio, the evening began to unfold in earnest. The state police presence increased. Governor Caperton's helicopter landed. State Senator Joe Manchin, Congressman Alan Mollohan, author Mark Shaw, and many other distinguished guests arrived. Yet despite the stature of those in attendance, the atmosphere never felt stiff. It felt celebratory. Earned.

One of the most meaningful moments of the entire weekend happened quietly, earlier that morning.

The day before, we had installed a bell on the 12th hole in memory of Pete's father. When Pete saw it that morning, he rang it. In that moment, my thoughts went back to a day years earlier when Pete took me to Urbana Country Club to see the first nine holes his father had ever built and the pride he felt walking that ground. Seeing Pete ring that bell was deeply moving. There wasn't a dry eye among those present.

The bell remains there today. I ask that you continue to ring it as you play through, in his honor.

Later that evening, after a brief welcome, Mark Shaw presented Pete and Alice with a copy of Bury Me in a Pot Bunker, accompanied by a heartfelt message. I then had the opportunity to speak about my years working with Pete, the long road we traveled together, the challenges we faced, and the friendship that grew along the way.

What followed was something truly special: Pete and Dad bantering back and forth, reliving stories and memories together. I've shared pieces of that journey here before, but there is nothing quite like hearing those stories told by the two people who lived them side by side.

The videos below capture Pete and Dad at the Grand Opening. Candid, comfortable, and connected by years of shared work and friendship.

I wasn't nervous at any point that day. Not once. Success, to me, revealed itself in the comments and accolades we received from those in attendance. The genuine appreciation, the sense that people understood what this place represented.

Looking back now, the overwhelming feeling is one of accomplishment. Eighteen years of effort had finally come together. More than that, it was deeply gratifying to see my dad and Pete enjoying the results of their work. To see them standing together, reflecting, satisfied. And yes, there was also a quiet satisfaction in silencing the naysayers who never believed this day would come.

To be in the company of a baseball legend, a Governor and future Governor, our Congressman, a noted author, the most influential course designer of his time and his wife, alongside our family and friends, remains one of the most memorable experiences of my life. The laughter that filled the night air felt like a release, a celebration, and a closing of a very long chapter.

After eighteen years, eighteen holes, and countless moments along the way, we had arrived.

The Grand Opening represented the closing of an 18-year chapter and the beginning of what would come next for the club.
