*A handshake on the 6th fairway, Alice Dye's debut, and the decisions that defined the late '80s of the Pete Dye Golf Club.*

By the late 1980s, the course was taking on more life. Conversations turned from dirt and drainage to questions of concept, irrigation, cart paths, clubhouses, and even marketing. An opening was still years away, but critical decisions loomed, all against the backdrop of another economic downturn.

## Naming the Club

Over the years we had discussed countless potential names. We even hired a local historian, Lenora Riley, to help us dig through the past for inspiration. "The Coal Club," "Burning Embers," "Cook's Mine Club." Local lore brought out options like "Chapel Point," "The Meadowbrook Club," and "Coal Ridge." We even explored Scottish names.

None of them fit. As the clock ticked, the process became frustrating.

One fall day, Pete and I were standing in the middle of #6 fairway when he asked, "Jimmy, do we have a name yet?"

"No," I told him.

"The hell with it," he said. "Let's make a decision. Let's call it Pete Dye."

As a young man, I was stunned. "Are you serious?"

He reached out, we shook hands, and the name was secured. I got emotional in that moment. Pete tossed down a few balls and asked me to hit wedges into the green. I promptly shanked the first one. Pete gave me that sheepish grin, took over the club, and started hitting shots himself.

He then said "I want you to know this will be the only club named after me."

"We would be honored, Pete." was my response and that was the end of our conversation.

In my opinion, that was Pete's way of showing respect for the commitment we had all made to one another over the last decade, a respect he later confirmed in an interview with Washington Golf Monthly.

It was a moment etched in my memory forever.

## The Club Concept

Naming the club was only one piece of the puzzle. What kind of club would it be?

On my travels I had experienced a wide range of models: high-end public clubs like PGA West, national membership clubs like The Honors Course, ultra-private bastions like Seminole, men's clubs like Oak Tree, corporate-styled clubs like Laurel Valley, and collector's clubs like Pine Valley, where members belonged to several elite courses.

Pete was adamant: he didn't want a club so restrictive that people couldn't see it. It was going to be too special to hide from view. He reminded me of our proximity to the East Coast and to the airport - and the opportunities that brought.

With his input, I settled on a hybrid: a national club with limited resident memberships, limited corporate memberships, and unlimited national and international. We also agreed not to make it prohibitively expensive at the start, letting the market dictate pricing over time.

It proved to be the right call.

After opening the membership quickly grew to 476 members across 27 states and 5 countries.

## Alice Makes Her Debut

Around this time Alice Dye made her first site visit. Leigh and I had recently been married, and Alice and Leigh quickly formed a friendship that would last.

Alice was no stranger to Pete's projects. She had consulted with him on multiple designs, most notably the TPC at Sawgrass. On her first walk of our course she wanted to start at #10 and she was eager to see the controversial 17th green.

Her impact was immediate. She called for forward tees on #10 and #11, and on #12 she suggested moving the mound in front of the green from the right side of the fairway to its current location.

When she asked again about forward tees, she suddenly turned to me: "Do you have plans for this to be a men's club?"

I admitted the idea had been tossed around but was highly unlikely. She spun to Pete: "Pete, if this is designed to be a men's club, you won't finish the course."

Pete's reply was another Pete classic: "Ok, Allie."

Her influence was felt right then and there. She continued recommending forward tees and even weighed in on #17.

"It's a little severe, don't you think? And what would you say if someone else built it?" Pete didn't respond, but the green was softened a little, specifically another pin location back left.

Over time Alice became Pete's gatekeeper, often answering calls in the evenings to shield him. Leigh and Alice grew close; in fact, we learned we had a better chance of getting Pete on the phone if Leigh called than if I did.

Looking back, those years were more than just about tees, names, or membership structures. They were about relationships. Pete and Alice, Dad and me, Leigh and Alice (to name just a few) that gave the project its shape and its heart. The course was no longer just lines on a map or dirt in the ground. It was becoming a living thing, with a name, a philosophy, and a future.
