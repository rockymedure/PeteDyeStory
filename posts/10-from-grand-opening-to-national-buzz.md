Happy New Year, everyone.

As we step into a new season of this story, I want to say thank you, truly, for following along and for being part of what made The Pete Dye Golf Club so special. In our season-ending Substack, we left off with our Grand Opening celebration. That day was a milestone for the club, but it was also the beginning of something much bigger than we ever could've predicted.

Going forward, we'll continue sharing the behind-the-scenes story, but we'll also start featuring more of the people who brought the place to life. That means more stories about recognition the club received, our staff, our members and their families, special events, our permanent clubhouse opening celebration, the Nationwide Tournament, interviews with members and staff, and more.

## Links Magazine — The Spark That Lit the Fuse

Not long after our opening, Links Magazine featured the club in their August "Modern Classic" issue. A nine page article, written by Bradley Klein, a well-known and respected golf writer.

It was a spectacular piece, and it genuinely catapulted the course into the national conversation.

Brad called the club "a monument to its creator" and "one of the most visually stunning layouts in America." That kind of recognition, that early, was a defining moment for us.

> "Local skeptics and observers throughout the golf industry were muttering that the LaRosa family would never see the project completed. Not one to be deterred, though, James D. LaRosa, a rags-to-riches coal magnate, had hopes of giving something back to the working class community in which he fulfilled his American Dream."

## Membership Growth and Protecting the Experience

After the Links Magazine feature, membership inquiries rose dramatically and they weren't just coming from nearby. Interest started pouring in from across the country.

Ultimately, the club grew to **474 members** from **27 states** and **five countries**, with the majority coming from the Mid-Atlantic region.

As exciting as that growth was, it also brought us to the most important question we faced:

*How do we grow without losing what makes this place special?*

We watched our round activity closely, because that dictated when we would reach capacity. That single factor mattered more than anything else in protecting the National Club concept and protecting the experience our members were promised.

Before long, we were nearing capacity, which put stress on our infrastructure. We found ourselves discussing ideas we *never* expected to be discussing so soon: a third clubhouse and additional lodging.

More on that in a future article — because that chapter deserves its own telling.

## Exposure Without Compromise

While protecting member access to the course was always our primary objective, we also knew something else was true:

If we were going to build a national club, we needed national exposure.

Through Pete's recommendation, we hosted a **Northern Club Professional Championship qualifier** for club professionals from throughout the East Coast, with the finals held at Pinehurst.

The tournament was a big success for the club, not just because it ran well, but because it put the course in front of the exact people who could speak about it with credibility.

Those club professionals became ambassadors for the club for many years and there's no better marketing than respected people telling the truth about what they experienced.

## A Historic Decision

In late 1996, we were contacted by the West Virginia Golf Association to gauge our interest in hosting the WV State Amateur in 1998.

It would have been the first time in 60 years the tournament would be held outside of The Greenbrier.

Conversations continued into 1997. We were honored to be asked, but we also weren't immediately convinced. Hosting a championship is a big commitment, and we were still carefully balancing the member experience with everything else.

Then came a luncheon at Seminole that winter — with Pete, Bill Campbell, and me.

That conversation made the decision clear.

With their involvement, the tournament was scheduled for 1998.

## The Heart of the Story

I'd be remiss if I didn't begin including photos of our members, their families, and our staff.

The club provided the foundation for our experiences, but it was the *people* who provided the memories.

Below, I'm going to start sharing photos. There's no specific order, and they will stretch across the years.

My hope is that as you scroll through them, they bring back the kind of moments you can't manufacture. The ones that happen when *a place* becomes *your place*.

*[Note: Original article included photos of members and staff including Pete Kaites, Dale Ramsburg, Brian Aman, David Reuben, Ray Celedinas, Perry Petropolis, Johnny Aman, John Crow, Eddie Aman, Ed Aman, and Lee Trevino with James D. LaRosa and Jimmy LaRosa]*

## Pete Dye Snippets

You've read my story about Pete's first visit, but you haven't heard Pete tell it. Take a look at the video below for Pete and James D. tunnel adventure, as told by Pete.

**Next Sunday:** After the Grand Opening, the story takes a turn. Recognition begins to spread, rankings start to climb, and the club finds its footing in a changing golf economy. We'll share staff memories, revisit the WV Amateur, hear more from Pete, and bring you inside the tournaments that helped define life at the club.
