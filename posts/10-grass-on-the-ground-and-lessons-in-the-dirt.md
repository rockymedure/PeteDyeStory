# Grass On The Ground and Lessons In The Dirt: The Pete Dye Golf Club Story Continues

*How the late '80s brought new partners, new challenges, and a course still finding its form.*

By the close of the 1980s, the Pete Dye Golf Club was no longer just an idea scribbled on maps or sketched into coal-scarred hills. Possible grand-opening dates were actually being discussed. The dream was close enough to taste.

But before ribbons could be cut, two important men arrived, the economy turned south again, and Dad learned twice over that Pete Dye was in charge!

## A Course Needs Caretakers

Pete knew we needed an agronomist, someone who could coax life from this raw ground. He recommended Dick Psolla, one of the top experts in the country and renowned for his knowledge of bentgrass.

On his first trip, Dick took soil and water samples and sent them off for testing. The results weren't perfect, we sat in a transition zone for bent, but new strains had just become available that he believed could thrive here. Simpson Creek offered water, but he had concerns.

His solution: build a backup line to the West Fork River.

So we did. More than two miles of six-inch pipe laid straight through the hills. Overkill to some, but typical for this project. With Pete's approval, we pressed forward.

## Enter Gary Grandstaff

Next came the superintendent. Pete suggested a man named Gary Grandstaff, one of his trusted lieutenants. Gary first heard about the project in Anaheim, California, when Pete told him a "crazy Italian friend" of his was building a course in coal country and he ought to expect a call.

That call came at 4 a.m. Gary's time.

By early 1989, he was walking the land in West Virginia and he never left.

Gary fell in love with the project, took the superintendent's job, and for the next three decades was tied to the course at the hip. Imagine tending 250 acres of bentgrass every single day for thirty years. The place shaped him, and he shaped it.

In his own words: "It was the greatest time of my life."

Gary remains a close friend of our family, and soon we'll share a podcast we recorded together where he reflects on Pete's philosophy and those years we spent building something against all odds.

## A Bad Economy and Expensive Grass

Those odds were stacked against us. The late '80s and early '90s brought another economic downturn. Oil prices rose, real estate stalled, manufacturing slowed. Refinancing was almost impossible. We turned to unconventional (and punishing) financing just to keep the project alive.

Still, we kept digging.

Installing irrigation came next. We chose Rain Bird and began with the front nine, though work was still incomplete. Installation happened piecemeal, complicated by the sheer scale: 240 acres of fairways and rough, with irrigation running as many as five rows wide in some places. The system alone came in far above projections.

But then came the miracle: green grass.

Watching bentgrass spread across the front nine, the first living color to cover these grounds in decades, was rejuvenating. For the first time, we could see the course as Pete imagined it - rolling, vibrant, alive.

## Pete Always Gets the Last Word

With grass underfoot, Dad was itching to have his say in design. For years he had pitched Pete ideas, often given a grin and shake of head by Pete in return. But one afternoon in the A-Frame, he suggested making the 17th green the smallest in the world since players would be hitting short irons in.

Pete smiled. "I like it, Jim."

Dad lit up. Finally, a win!

Then Pete added: "But instead, I'll make it the largest green with the smallest putting area."

So much for the victory!

## The 18th Hole Debacle

If 17 was a tease, 18 was a full-blown lesson. With Pete away and dirt-moving equipment on hand, Dad decided to take initiative. He thought the finishing green should be closer to the clubhouse site, sparing golfers the long uphill walk.

For ten whole days, crews hauled thousands of yards of dirt to reshape the hole. Dad beamed, certain Pete would approve.

When Pete returned, he stared down the hill and asked: "Jim, what in the hell did you do?"

Dad explained his reasoning. Pete shook his head. "No, Jim. I want the green down by Simpson Creek."

Dad went pale but promised: "The fairway and green will be where you want them by the time you get back."

And they were. Every yard of dirt was hauled back out.

The 18th hole golfers play today is Pete's hole, not Dad's. And maybe that's the point.

## Looking Back

The turn of the decade brought grass in the ground, water in the pipes, and two men, Dick Psolla and Gary Grandstaff, who would help shape the club forever. It also brought tough lessons about vision, humility, and persistence.

For the first time, the Pete Dye Golf Club was more than an idea. It was real, and it was growing, in every sense of the word.
