By the mid to late 1990s, you could feel it everywhere. The economy was rebounding, the real estate market was strong, and golf activity was surging. Tiger Woods' popularity brought new eyes to the game and real estate growth was expanding across the entire industry. More people were playing, more clubs were expanding, and interest in "destination golf" was climbing.

At the time, it felt like we were riding a wave. But looking back, that wave also set the stage for some difficult years for golf in the early to mid 2000s. For now though, in the late 90s, we were in a season of momentum. Membership was growing. Rounds were up. And with that growth came a simple reality:

If we wanted to compete with the best national clubs, we had to build an experience that matched the course.

### Recognition and Rankings

As the club continued to mature, we began receiving increased recognition - rankings from Golf Digest, Golfweek, and others. It was exciting, but it also raised a question that eventually became hard to ignore:

We weren't seeing many of the people who actually do the ranking visiting the course.

Typically, ranking committee members or media groups get introduced to clubs through official receptions, social events, or orchestrated outings, the kind of "entertaining influence" that can shape a first impression.

After talking it through with Pete, it became clear he did not like that approach.

Pete's preference was simple: let the course stand on its own. No spectacle. No polishing it up for a committee. No dog-and-pony show. If it deserved to be recognized, it would earn it the right way.

The problem was, we were so far off the beaten path that not many ranking committee members were making their way into West Virginia on their own.

Shortly after that conversation, Pete made a few strategic calls to friends in the industry and, almost overnight, we started seeing visits from ranking committee members in a very short period of time.

Those visits led to rankings that placed the course among the elite of the elite.

**Rankings:**
- Golf Digest
- Golf Magazine
- Golfweek

### Expanding the Experience

I'll be honest, I never envisioned needing to build lodging or a third clubhouse so quickly.

But the growth was real. With membership development and the rising level of activity, it became evident that if we wanted to compete with other national golf clubs for members, we needed to "complete the experience." It wasn't just about having a world-class course. It was about creating an all-encompassing environment. A place members and their guests could come, stay, and feel taken care of from start to finish.

After consulting with Pete, we selected an area past the clubhouse for the development of corporate lodges and townhouses. At one point, we could lodge up to approximately 100 members and guests. A residential area was included as well and, staying true to our commitment to the club, none of the homes were built on fairways.

The new clubhouse also became a priority. The original proposed site was directly above the #10 tee, but it quickly became clear that the area was too small for what we needed.

And this is where one of my favorite clubhouse stories begins.

It wasn't until Johnny Aman and I were sitting there, drinking a couple cold beers and talking it through, that we realized the solution was moving the site to where it is now. By putting an angle in the building layout, the current site suddenly worked perfectly. And even better: by angling it, we could create views down the 18th fairway — something that wasn't possible otherwise.

After another hour of conversation (and a couple more beers) it became clear this was the right approach.

Thanks, Johnny.

That same day I got in touch with my friends and members Steve Barnum and Richard Forren with Omni Associates, and away we went.

(Much more on this story in future episodes.)

### Our Signature Events

As the club grew, our events grew with it. Two of them quickly became signature experiences:

#### The Member-Guest

Our Member-Guest tournaments expanded to two events per year, drawing members and their friends from across the country. They weren't just tournaments, they became annual reunions. Relationships formed not only between participants, but between members and staff.

Our caddy program, built and strengthened through the efforts of Bill Sines, John Rappold, and others, was never more on display than during these tournaments.

The welcoming attitude. The white caddie uniforms. The personalities. The pride these young men and women took in representing their hometown and the club. Their enthusiasm was infectious and it led to relationships that lasted years.

Combined with the course, the facilities, the staff, and our genuine commitment to hospitality, these events produced some of the most memorable golf experiences of people's lives. Something I know because I received countless comments and letters through the years saying exactly that.

And the stories? Those will be shared later. There are plenty.

#### The Club Championships

The Club Championships brought our members together in a different way.

Vying to put your name on one of our championship plaques became special.

Competing against players from across the country added to the intensity and you could feel that tension in the air all week. Posting a respectable score on a championship course and taking home hardware from the club that felt like something you earned.

#### The West Virginia State Amateur

Hosting the WV State Amateur is an honor — and when we were first asked, I'll admit I wasn't immediately sure. My first thoughts went straight to the members: taking the course out of play for basically a week didn't feel like it was in their best interest. But after meeting with Pete and Bill Campbell and hearing their input, I changed course and agreed.

The tournament was a success.

We had multiple members qualify to play. Member participation was strong. And we gained statewide recognition from golfers who had never been here before.

Past champions played, including Steve Fox, Harold Payne, Pat Carter, and others. And the course proved to be even more difficult than anticipated. Pat Carter won the Championship again.

Members and staff who qualified were John A. Markovich, Todd Trickett, John Rappold and Steve Shrawder.

As a result of hosting this event, we gained more than a tournament. We gained another layer of validation that this course could hold up under championship conditions.

*As an added bonus from tournament week, here's one for the record books. My son-in-law, Eddie Aman, caddied for his good friend Steve Shrawder. Well, at least for the first seven holes. By the time they reached #8, there was a "parting of the ways," and according to legend, Steve fired Eddie and carried his own bag the rest of the day. If you ever run into either of them, ask for the story. It's worth your while.*

Looking back, the late 90's were the years when everything started to stack: recognition, membership, activity, events, and the beginnings of an expanded campus. We weren't just maintaining a great course anymore. We were building a place people traveled to, stayed at, and remembered. And in many ways, this stretch set the tone for everything that came next.
