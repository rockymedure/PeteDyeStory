*1991 Ryder Cup memories, a new logo, Senator Randolph's stones, and the friends who captured it all.*

By 1991, we had been at it for more than a decade. The course was finally beginning to look like golf. The front nine pushed ahead of the back, irrigation was underway, financing was still fragile, and talk of an opening in 1993 was starting to feel possible. But progress on the ground wasn't the only story that year. 1991 was the year the Pete Dye Golf Club began to take on a soul.

## Inside The Ropes

During the Fall of 1991, Pete and Alice invited me to the Ryder Cup. That year, it was nicknamed "The War by the Shore," and was played at Pete and Alice Dye's newly constructed Ocean Course on Kiawah Island, South Carolina. I already knew Pete's reputation in design, but being with him inside the ropes was something else entirely.

Thousands of people lined the fairways, and when Pete walked by, chants of "Pete Dye! Pete Dye!" erupted from the crowd. It was electric. In that moment, I understood. This wasn't just a golf course we were building. Carrying Pete's name meant carrying a responsibility to him, to the game, to our families, and to our community.

When I returned home, I began drafting a mission statement that would guide every decision we made. After several revisions, I landed on one our growing staff could embrace.

They did, wholeheartedly. And It became our compass.

## The Logo is Born

Identity also meant something visual. In golf, a logo is more than a mark; it's a brand, a flag, a statement. Pete introduced me to Ann Timberman, who visited the course and quickly grasped its spirit. She produced sketches that captured the essence of what we were building.

Tragically, Ann passed away soon after.

Within weeks, the Pete Dye Golf Club had its logo, which was a symbol that became known across the industry and beloved by our members.

## Steps to #1 Tee

Around the same time, Senator Jennings Randolph and his son Jay, a broadcaster with the St. Louis Cardinals, were strong supporters of our project. The Senator asked if we could relocate his Salem home rather than see it demolished. Dad, Bob Andrews, and I studied it and agreed to try. Moving houses wasn't exactly our specialty, but we managed.

During the process, Jay asked if some of the old foundation stones could be preserved at the course in his father's memory. We agreed, and today those stones sit at the very start of #1 tee, forming the steps that lead to the back tee.

A quiet reminder of the ties between this land, its people, and its history.

## The Storykeepers

Through all of this, one couple was there with cameras rolling: Louie and Nancy Ellis. Louie had been a family friend since the 1940s, known first as host and DJ at the Brothers 4 Supper Club before taking up video work in retirement. In 1978, he turned his lens on our project and never left, for 20 years.

Together, Louie and Nancy documented everything: the dirt work, the site visits, the near-misses, the milestones. At the end of each session, Louie would sign off with his trademark line:

"No charge — Louie signing off." And he meant it.

Without them, much of this history would be gone. Because of them, we can share it with you today.

Reflecting on the year of 1991, It's amusing to think that while we were chasing financing, irrigation lines, and opening dates, the soul of the club was being built in quieter ways — in chants at a Ryder Cup, in a sketch of a logo, in stones carried from a senator's home, and in the lens of a friend who never once sent a bill.
