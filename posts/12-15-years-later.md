# 15 Years Later: The Pete Dye Golf Club Sets An Opening Date

*When patience, persistence and a priest help finish what we started.*

By the early 1990s, after nearly a decade and a half of false starts, floods, and endless tinkering, we finally circled a date on the calendar: July 4, 1993.

Independence Day. A fitting moment for the Pete Dye Golf Club to open its gates.

The plan was bold. But as anyone who has ever built anything with Pete Dye knows, plans and reality don't always run in sync. The front nine was playable and ready. The back nine, though, lagged behind. So we opened as promised, but with only the front nine. The back nine would wait until exactly a year later, July 4, 1994.

And when would the official grand opening come? At Pete's urging, not until 1995.

"Give it another season," he said. Let the grass settle, the bunkers age, the bones of the course show their true character before the critics arrived with their pencils.

## Why Did It Take 17 Years?

Seventeen years. That's how long it took from the first idea in 1978 to the official opening in 1995. Why so long?

Part of it was practical: Pete's crowded schedule, our own commitments to other projects, and a mutual agreement that there was no need to rush. Then came the two "hundred-year floods" that nearly washed us away, a rollercoaster economy, and the endless experiments — cart paths made of red dog, bunkers filled with coal cinders, washing our own sand, and an irrigation system large enough to rival a municipal water line.

And of course, there was the mine land itself. Reclaiming land moving dirt (sometimes more than once), and repairing what decades of coal left behind.

But the greater reason was one of intent. This course was being built to honor something bigger than golf: the immigrants, the coal miners, the industry, the state, and the two families, Dye and LaRosa, who tied it together.

Pete himself once said of my father: "James D. was the toughest, most tenacious, never-give-up son of a gun I ever worked for."

For perspective: the Brooklyn Bridge took 15 years to build. The Taj Mahal, 17. We were in good company.

## The Clubhouse: A Trailer and a Prayer

By the time an opening date was in sight, one truth was clear: every last cent had gone into the golf course. Pete was a minimalist at heart and had already pushed the budget to its limit. So we improvised.

We bought a double-wide trailer, fitted it with a kitchen, locker rooms, and a refurbished interior, and set up outdoor cart storage with a power station. It wasn't fancy, but it worked. Later, the permanent clubhouse would rise above the 18th hole. For now, our modest solution let us focus on what mattered: the golf.

## Learning Club Life

I was fortunate during this time to step into Pete and Alice's wide circle of friends, people who knew how to build not just golf courses, but golf clubs. Men like Buddy Antonopoulos of Old Marsh, Bob Ford of Oakmont, Gilles Gagnon of Teeth of the Dog, Jerry Pittman of Seminole, and Curt Siegel of Laurel Valley.

Their advice was priceless. How to run a member-guest. Why locker rooms matter more than you think. The virtue of oversized showerheads. How to greet a member at the bag drop. The power of a well-chosen halfway-house delicacy. And always, always: more storage and a well stocked golf shop.

One particular piece of advice that I recall was from Bob Ford: "Make every club tournament the most special event in your members life, because it may be the most important tournament they ever play in."

And we did.

That wisdom guided us until our own team of world-class professionals joined: Jim Jamieson and Bill Stines.

## Enter Jim Jamieson

In 1992, Bob Ford called me with a suggestion. "If you want the right fit for your club," he said, "it's Jim Jamieson."

Bob's record in placing top professionals was unmatched, and once I met Jim, I knew Bob was right again. Jim was a former Tour player who had won the Western Open wire-to-wire and contended at the Masters. He was charismatic, funny, full of stories, and connected across the industry. He didn't love administration, but he didn't need to. What he brought was energy, charm, and the ability to make members and guests feel like they belonged.

He was the right hire at the right time.

Bill joined us in 1994. Much more on Bill in upcoming episodes.

## A Chaplain for the Club

Every great club needs more than golf. Ours had Monsignor John O'Reilly.

He had married my parents decades earlier and was a beloved figure across central West Virginia. Proud of his Irish heritage, partial to a drink, and never afraid to tee it up in the rough, he became our official spiritual anchor. Almost daily, he'd come to the course, sit on a bench overlooking the 10th hole, and pray.

I don't know if the golf course itself made his list, but I'm certain he prayed for us to hurry up and finish so he could play.

In 1993, when the front nine opened, he was in the first foursome on the tee. Later, when the second clubhouse was built, we named the O'Reilly Room in his honor.
