# When the Tournament Became a Tradition

There are certain moments in a club's life when you realize you're not just hosting events anymore, you're building a culture.

For us, in the late 90's, that moment had a name:

**The Member Guest.**

It started with competition. A full tee sheet, plenty of pride, and that special kind of nervous energy you only get when people care. But it didn't take long to realize the tournament wasn't becoming popular because of the format.

It was becoming popular because of the *people.*

There was real camaraderie. The kind you can't manufacture. The kind where a guest shows up as a visitor and leaves feeling like a member.

Traditions seemed to appear out of thin air and quickly became non-negotiable. **The Simpson Creek Challenge**, for one. No matter how serious the competition got, there was always room for fun (and certainly a little chaos).

And then there were the details that made the whole weekend feel like something bigger than golf:

Kevin Dawson showing up with magic and somehow becoming part of the fabric of the event.

Chris and Donny Davidson providing the soundtrack through dinners, laughs, and late nights.

And George Ramirez (Mya Cigars) with cigar rolling that made it feel like you'd stepped into another era.

Even the guest list carried its own lore. Over the years we had sports celebrities join in —Mario Lemieux, Steve Spurrier, Jackie Nicklaus, John Kruk, and others who returned more than once. They didn't come back because the trophies were bigger.

They came back because the weekend felt alive.

But if you ask me one of the things that I remember most, it isn't a scorecard.

It's Kurt Skasik.

Kurt had a way of taking a tournament and turning it into an experience. He never failed to elevate the weekend —and anyone who was there knows exactly what I mean.

He had that infectious smile, and that Kurt quality where he always seemed to be "dealing with a situation" (usually self-created) and somehow doing it with so much charm you couldn't help but laugh. He was loyal, unforgettable, and one of those people who could shift the atmosphere of an entire room just by walking into it.

During Member Guest weekend, Kurt wasn't just participating: he was *performing*, in the best possible way.

If you saw his blackjack skills, you know.

If you stayed up far later than you planned because he had the whole crew laughing, you know.

If you remember him "looking for Eddie" to keep the game moving, you know.

And if you showed up to the first tee the next morning running on fumes because Kurt kept the energy going into the wee hours, well, you definitely know.

Kurt made the Member Guest feel like more than an event. He made it feel like a reunion, a tradition, a shared story that belonged to all of us.

*You will always be remembered, my friend.*

#### **Building the Future**

Here's what's funny about that period: while the club was creating these bigger and bigger weekends, we were also facing a truth behind the scenes.

If we were going to keep growing, we needed a clubhouse that could carry what we were becoming.

And that's where I went from "golf guy" to "student" real fast.

#### **Learning on the Fly**

I had visited plenty of great clubhouses. I knew what felt comfortable, what felt elevated, what flowed well. But I had never studied them in detail. Not from an operations point of view.

So I called the people who knew.

I contacted my friends at Omni Associates (Steve Barnum and Richard Forren) and Phil Weeser of March Westin Construction Company.

And just like that, it was game on.

Next, John Rappold and I went on a fact-finding mission, visiting as many clubs as we could. Not just for inspiration, but to learn what worked (and what definitely didn't).

The generosity we encountered on that trip was remarkable. General managers, chefs, maintenance teams, golf staffs, admin staffs —everyone wanted to help, and it made the whole effort far more worthwhile than I can explain.

We also had a huge advantage in Bill Stines, whose experience before joining us was invaluable. He helped us avoid mistakes we didn't even know we were about to make.

### **Building a Clubhouse Worthy of the Club**

When we returned, the team assembled, plans were finalized, and construction began. We were on a fast track for multiple reasons and somehow, it worked.

And here's a little club history for you: *Ron Biafore, March Westin's superintendent, ended up marrying my personal assistant, Shannon Hurt. Only at a club, right?*

The course took us **18 years.**

The clubhouse took about **a year and a half.**

It was an extraordinary effort by everyone involved, and the details mattered more than I ever realized until we were in it. Everything from lockers and shower heads to cart storage, the caddy room, food and beverage, and the traffic flow through the golf shop. Even the things guests never see, they always *feel.*

My friend Steve Barnum put up with all my input: graciously accepted it, corrected me, and humored me through the process. He helped make it a great experience and a great clubhouse.

*Thank you. Steve.*

## **A Booming Market**

This era didn't just feel busy inside our gates, it was busy everywhere.

The golf economy hit a high mark around 2000. Courses were opening at a rapid pace and the industry rode that wave for several years, until signs of weakening began to show.

*More on that later: because that story matters, too.*

## **The 2000 WV Open**

After hosting the State Amateur, we made the decision to host the **2000 WV Open**.

By that point, we weren't just filling dates on a calendar, we were building a reputation. And the WV Open wasn't just another tournament you "hosted." It was a piece of West Virginia golf history.

The tournament had been held for **66 consecutive years** (with only one exception). Tradition mattered to us: it was part of why we believed we should be the host venue.

And the history attached to that event was no joke.

**Sam Snead** had won it **17 times**, including **1957**, when he finished ahead of second-place finisher…our very own **Mike Krak.** That year marked our first TV recognition, and it was the first time we exposed the course, not just to members, but to amateurs and professionals across the state and beyond.

We didn't know what to expect from the crowds, but the response said everything.

Member support was strong, and the spectator participation was even better. You could feel it. That sense that this wasn't just happening *at* the club. It was happening *with* the club.

### **An Unforgettable Hometown Run**

And then, as if the weekend needed another layer of electricity, our very own **Steve Shrawder** put himself in the mix.

On the final day, Steve turned the front nine at **two-under** and suddenly he was in contention. As he made the turn, a member gallery formed and grew by the hole. Everyone thinking the same thing: *Could one of ours do this?*

He birdied **#10**. The gallery grew again.

Then on **#11**, he caught a fortuitous bounce off the hillside and, as legend has it, it was found by none other than Ron Braddock. Steve birdied again and moved to **four-under**.

With **Johnny "Ballgame" Shields** on the bag, they were officially in the hunt. After **#15**, Steve was **five-under** and, at that point, it didn't feel like a tournament anymore.

It felt like a stadium.

### **The Moment the Clubhouse Erupted**

On **#18**, Steve's second shot finished about **25 feet** from the flag. Ballgame read the line and told him to commit.

Everyone was watching.

The putt rolled and when it got to about **four feet** from the hole, Ballgame shouted:

**"Pick it up!"**

And then it dropped.

The place erupted. Members shouting, pounding on the glass. One of those moments you never forget because you can still feel it years later.

**Brad Westfall** went on to win by a couple shots. But that weekend gave us something that mattered just as much as the final score:

It gave us *legends.*

It gave us *stories.*

It gave us that shared feeling that we were stepping into something bigger than ourselves.

And that's what the late 90's at the Pete Dye Golf Club really were. A time when the club began to feel like it had momentum. Not just on the course, but in the community around it.

**Next Sunday:** *The new clubhouse opens: what it meant to finally see that vision come to life…plus our Monday Outings, and the early talk of bringing a professional tournament to the club.*

## Key Details

This post covers the late 90's era at the Pete Dye Golf Club, a period when the club transitioned from simply hosting events to building a culture. The central focus is **The Member Guest Tournament**, which became popular not because of its format, but because of the people and camaraderie it fostered.

The tournament developed traditions organically, including **The Simpson Creek Challenge**, which added fun and chaos to the serious competition. Key contributors to the event's atmosphere included Kevin Dawson (magic), Chris and Donny Davidson (music and entertainment), and George Ramirez of Mya Cigars (cigar rolling). The tournament also attracted sports celebrities like Mario Lemieux, Steve Spurrier, Jackie Nicklaus, and John Kruk, who returned multiple times because of the vibrant weekend experience.

A particularly memorable figure was **Kurt Skasik**, who elevated the Member Guest from an event to an experience. Known for his infectious smile, blackjack skills, and ability to keep the energy going late into the night, Kurt became central to the tournament's identity, making it feel like a reunion and tradition.

Behind the scenes, the club recognized it needed a new clubhouse to support its growth. Jimmy transitioned from "golf guy" to "student," consulting with Steve Barnum and Richard Forren of Omni Associates, Phil Weeser of March Westin Construction Company, and going on a fact-finding mission with John Rappold to visit other clubs. With help from Bill Stines' experience, the clubhouse was built in about a year and a half (compared to 18 years for the course).

The golf economy was booming around 2000, with courses opening rapidly. The club hosted the **2000 WV Open**, a tournament with 66 consecutive years of history (with one exception). The event had deep historical significance—Sam Snead had won it 17 times, including 1957 when he finished ahead of the club's own Mike Krak.

The 2000 WV Open featured an unforgettable hometown run by **Steve Shrawder**. On the final day, he turned the front nine at two-under, birdied holes #10 and #11 (with a fortuitous bounce found by Ron Braddock), and reached five-under after #15, with Johnny "Ballgame" Shields caddying. On hole #18, Steve made a dramatic 25-foot putt that caused the clubhouse to erupt with members shouting and pounding on the glass. Brad Westfall ultimately won, but the weekend created legends, stories, and a shared feeling that the club was stepping into something bigger.

This era represented a time when the club began to feel like it had momentum—not just on the course, but in the community around it.
