*How snowstorms, setbacks, and a skeleton crew built the spirit of Pete Dye Golf Club before it ever opened.*

When we set the official opening date for July 4th, 1993, we felt confident. After all, our past winters had been relatively mild, and we expected to make steady progress through the cold months on the back nine.

But Mother Nature had other plans.

That December, a nor'easter swept through the East Coast, burying the course under nearly 30 inches of snow. By late January, the wind and ice had left no doubt. Our schedule had been upended. And just when we thought we could dig out, the "Storm of the Century" hit in March, dropping another two feet of snow across north-central West Virginia.

At that point, Pete and I sat down and made the call: we'd push forward with the opening of the front nine only. The back nine would wait until 1994. It wasn't the plan, but it was the only way forward.

## Our First PGA Show

With our logo finalized, Jim Jamieson and I packed our bags for Orlando to attend our first PGA Merchandise Show. Between Pete's popularity, Jim's reputation, and word spreading that this fifteen-year project bearing Pete's name was nearing completion, we found ourselves surprisingly popular. Vendors, media, and fellow professionals all wanted to hear the story.

We scheduled merchandise orders, meetings, and spring appointments with more optimism than sleep. After years of setbacks, this trip made one thing clear: it was game on.

## The Clubhouse

In true Pete Dye Golf Club fashion, we kept things simple to start. We purchased a double-wide trailer, attached it to the A-frame, and added decks, locker rooms, a kitchen, and a golf shop.

That "temporary" clubhouse became the heart of the Club in those early years. The deck overlooking the ninth green hosted countless stories, laughs, and sunsets. Many of you reading this will remember those evenings vividly - the ones that made the wait all worth it.

## Building the Team

By early 1993, I officially took on the role of General Manager and led the membership development efforts. I was fortunate to surround myself with an outstanding staff, each person as dedicated as they were different.

Alexis Cava, our comptroller, was the backbone of the operation. She kept the books balanced, the refinancing organized, and, frankly, kept the rest of us in line. Between James D., Pete, myself, and the daily flood of expenses, Alexis had her hands full, but she handled it with absolute command.

Billy Pulice became Director of Membership Services and quickly proved invaluable. He jumped into every corner of the operation and played a key role in our early marketing efforts. He and I spent more late nights than I can count perfecting our membership presentation, stories for another day.

Patrick Geraghty joined Jim Jamieson's golf staff and brought a spark to our growing team. Today, he's the golf professional at Druid's Glen in Ireland, a testament to his talent and drive.

Craig Fortner came aboard in 1994 as Assistant Superintendent, recommended by agronomist Dick Psolla. Craig's skill and work ethic were exactly what Gary Grandstaff needed as we prepared the back nine for opening.

And Denny Davidson, who'd worked with me for nearly a decade, took charge of general maintenance. There wasn't anything Denny couldn't fix - or anyone he wouldn't help. His loyalty extended even to Dad's "extended family" of 13 dogs and 9 cats.

As we edge closer to the official opening in these stories, I'll highlight the rest of the incredible characters who brought Pete Dye Golf Club to life.

## Membership: Doing It Ourselves

Rather than hire a membership development firm, I decided to take it on personally. By early '93, our membership collateral package was complete. Billy and I worked around the clock at a local TV station, editing video and refining our presentation. The membership collateral that we developed is still being utilized today, 32 years later.

With Harris Holt narrating a detailed walkthrough of the course, the finished video became the centerpiece of our first membership event - held, fittingly, in the basement of our house. My wife, Leigh Ann, and our friend Tammy Urso orchestrated the entire evening flawlessly.

Even knowing the back nine wouldn't open until 1994, the confidence our early prospective members showed was remarkable. Their faith in us fueled everything that followed.

Some of those attendees are as follows Don Baldini • Everett Ross • Dave King • Earl Flowers • Pete Katie • Jack Gocke • Louie Bonasso • Frank Oliverio • Jim Rogers • Darwin Johnson • Bill Creighton • The Amans • Pat Kelly • Jim Frush • Jeff Votaw • Sam Urso • Bob Ferrel • Bob Haden • Curt Skasik • Frank Demarino • Bill Pringle • Sam Urso • Munk Israel.

## Our First Club Photographer

At Pete's recommendation, we invited Brian Morgan, one of the world's leading golf photographers, to visit in early spring. His work captured the spirit of Pete Dye Golf Club from its earliest days.

Brian became an ambassador for us, spreading the word globally and even helping us attract six international members. He also gave Billy and me one of the greatest experiences of our lives: walking inside the ropes with him at the Masters on Press Passes.

## Looking Back

When I think back to that winter of 1992 and the spring that followed, it's hard to believe how much was accomplished amid so many setbacks. Between blizzards, budget juggling, and long nights fueled by faith and coffee, the Club was finally beginning to take shape - not just as a golf course, but as a community.

We were still months away from opening, and only half the course was ready, but the spirit of the place had already revealed itself. It lived in the people who believed in us, the staff who showed up every morning, and the laughter that filled that little clubhouse deck overlooking the ninth green. In a way, the Club had already opened, it just didn't have a ribbon yet.
