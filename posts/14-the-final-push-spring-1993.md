*Coming out of the winter that tested everything, we had one goal left - open the course.*

By March of 1993, the brutal winter was finally behind us, but it had left its mark. The snow, ice, and wind had delayed nearly every facet of construction. Even as the thaw came, we were still scrambling to complete what seemed like a thousand unfinished details.

Irrigation on #8 wasn't yet finished. The cart storage area was still a shell. The clubhouse interior needed completed, the entrance road was unfinished, and the pump station for the irrigation system was waiting to be installed. Bent grass damaged by the severe winter needed reseeded. The high wall along #8 fairway bunker had to be repaired. Red dog still needed spread across every cart path on the front nine. Sewage lines had to be laid. And we still hadn't made a final decision on food and beverage operations.

We were only months away from opening.

There were a lot of moving parts. Nothing new for us by that point. But Spring brought with it renewed energy and momentum.

## Membership Momentum

As we shifted our focus beyond West Virginia, we knew the first impression mattered, especially since we'd only be opening nine holes that summer. Fortunately, Pete and Alice were at the height of their popularity. In the world of golf course design, they had become something of cult heroes.

Courses that bore Pete completed during that era read like a greatest hits list: La Quinta Resort, PGA West, The Medalist, Old Marsh, TPC Sawgrass (both courses), Brickyard Crossing, Oak Tree, Long Cove, The Honors Course, Blackwolf Run, and La Romana's Valley Course.

And of course, the "War by the Shore" Ryder Cup at Kiawah's Ocean Course had cemented their legacy.

Pete had also earned a nickname along the way, "Penal Pete," for the demanding nature of his designs. I remember standing beside him at PGA West when a golf writer asked, "Pete, do you think this course is too hard for the average player?" Pete paused, looked out over the fairway, and with a grin said,

"Don't know. But maybe you should call and try to get a tee time - they're booked a year out. You tell me."

Interview over.

We leaned into that reputation. Using the collateral we'd developed, and with the support and referrals of our friends and early members, we began traveling — to Pittsburgh, Columbus, Washington D.C., and Virginia, sharing our story personally and inviting golfers to visit once we opened.

The response was overwhelming. Word was spreading fast about this coal mine turned golf club. Pete and Alice's involvement opened doors we never could have on our own.

## Progress at Last

By late March, the thaw turned to progress. The projects that had been frozen all winter began to move forward in a rush.

Jim Jamieson started assembling his staff in late May. Julio's (Joe and Pam Iaquinta) were hired to oversee the restaurant operations, a decision that delighted our local members. Merchandise began arriving. The entrance road and cart paths were completed.

Final preparations for opening were underway: an opening breakfast, golf tournament, cocktail party, dinner, bagpipers, and fireworks.

Meanwhile, Pete was laser-focused on the back nine. The irrigation system installation was in full swing and he was adding his finishing touches: rock walls along #14, #15, and #18, and final shaping on #17 green.

Just when things seemed steady, we discovered a leak in the lake at #15. The only solution was to drain it completely, trench across #17 fairway, reseal the entire lake, and fill it again. Another delay but, by then, we were used to setbacks.

## Pete, Dad, and the Deer

For all the long hours and tension, there were moments that reminded us of who we were doing it with — and why.

Dad and Pete shared a deep love for animals and never allowed hunting on the property. One day the previous November, however, a hunter shot a deer near the entry. Dad called the police, and the man was arrested.

Later that day, the police called back. The hunter was remorseful. He had no car, a family to feed, and had hunted only out of necessity.

Dad paused, then told them not to book him. He and Pete drove to the jail themselves, picked the man up, took him to the grocery store, bought him food, returned his gun, and got him a ride home.

That was Pete and Dad. Tough when they needed to be, but never without heart.

## Wrapping Up Spring 1993

As June drew near, the course (and all of us) were running on equal parts exhaustion and adrenaline. The sight of grass turning green again, the sound of mowers in the morning, the smell of freshly cut grass, clubhouse lights glowing at dusk, and even being able to hit a few balls on the range, it was the end of one era and the beginning of another.

After fifteen years of planning, setbacks, storms, and stubborn determination, the front nine of Pete Dye Golf Club was nearly ready to welcome its first players.

The dream was no longer on paper or in Pete's sketches. It stood before us. Fifteen years of faith, failure, and persistence, transformed from black rock into green fairway.
