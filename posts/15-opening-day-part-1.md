# Opening Day, Part 1: The Final Push at Pete Dye Golf Club

*Fifteen years in the making and the course was finally becoming a club.*

After all the years of clearing, shaping, seeding, and waiting, we found ourselves not just building a golf course anymore, we were building a club. The people, the systems, the stories: all of it began to take form in those final weeks before the gates opened.

What had once been a construction site was suddenly coming alive with faces, voices, and purpose. The team that would give the club its character was stepping into place.

## The Golf Staff

Leading our golf operations was Jim Jamieson, our head professional, a name many of you already know well. Referred by Bob Ford of Oakmont Country Club, Jim brought with him a remarkable blend of tour experience, Greenbrier polish, and genuine love for the game. As a PGA Tour player he finished 3rd and 5th at the Masters, won the Quad Cities and the Western Open.

He was as much storyteller as teacher. Equal parts mentor, entertainer, and competitor. His Saturday-night "Blood Bath" matches became instant legend, and his steady leadership helped define the tone of our early club culture. Working alongside him was Patrick Geherty, his first assistant.

Our outside operations team quickly became the face of the club. Tommy and Brian Aman, John Rappold, Mike Toms, and Eric Rettinger: the ones loading carts, greeting members, and managing the flow of play, often before sunrise and long after sunset.

They were locals, golfers, and proud to represent something special being built in their hometown. Their work ethic and personalities created the welcoming atmosphere members still remember from those early years.

Having had the privilege of visiting clubs across the country, I can say with certainty there wasn't a finer staff anywhere. I was truly fortunate to have them on our team.

## Food & Beverage Operations

If there was one department that kept me up at night, it was this one.

Knowing next to nothing about Food & Beverage, I turned to Pam Iaquinta of Julio's, a name well known and loved by our local members. Pam and her team were fine-dining professionals (elegant service, white tablecloths, the works) and here I was, asking them to adapt to the rhythm of a golf club.

Pam, Leigh, and I spent those last weeks developing menus, training staff, and bridging that gap between formal dining and club life.

It worked.

Their food was exceptional, their service warm, and our members loved it. Many will still remember Chef Maria Pischeri, Patrick Lugardo, and our head waiter Oscar. They'll all make an appearance in next week's video.

## Tee Markers and Shadow Boxes

Every last detail mattered, right down to the tee markers.

Just weeks before opening, we decided to honor our coal-country roots with something special: tee markers made of epoxied lumps of coal. Gary Grandstaff's crew crafted them by hand in our maintenance building, and we were proud of the result. They gleamed in the sun, a symbol of the land's past, now giving way to its future.

There was just one small problem.

A few weeks later, while playing with my friends Eddie and Johnny Aman, one of them (after a wild shot over the wall) gave a friendly "tap" to a coal marker with his driver. It exploded on impact. That's when I realized why they'd been disintegrating!

That moment led directly to the iron tee markers you see today.

Around the same time, we received something that took our breath away: the shadow boxes.

These cases would hold the names of our club champions forever. I'd had them designed in Palm Beach, and when they arrived, it felt like the final brushstroke. They gave the clubhouse a sense of history and permanence, a reminder that this wasn't just a golf course anymore. It was a club with legacy.

## Red Dog Cart Paths

In the scramble of those final days, we finished compacting the red dog cart paths, just as the carts arrived. The carts themselves had been delayed because we insisted on a special shade of green paint to match our club colors.

The carts finally rolled in.

Our first test drive didn't go as planned. The red dust from the cart paths clung to tires, shoes, and anything it could find. When it dried, it became bouncy. So much so that drinks in cupholders bounced clean out.

We knew immediately this experiment was over. Within days, we were already planning to pave the paths in blacktop before the back nine opened.

Our golf staff worked tirelessly cleaning carts between rounds. I will forever owe them for that.

## Two Days to Go

Then came the rain.

It started (and didn't stop) until the night before opening day.

We still had sod to lay and two bunkers on #9 waiting for sand. After fifteen years, to be stopped by weather at the finish line felt almost cruel. I was embarrassed, truthfully.

As if that weren't enough, most of our merchandise hadn't yet arrived. I was certain we'd open the golf shop half empty: until, finally, boxes began to roll in the day before opening.

Alexis dove straight into logging inventory. Donna, Billy, and I unpacked boxes through the night. Pam was hauling Julio's finest china, silver, and crystal for the restaurant. We worked straight through until daylight.

And through it all, my wife Leigh, was right there — helping, directing, and somehow also caring for our two little girls, Lauren and Natalie, who were just toddlers then.

Pete couldn't be at opening day. He had a long-standing commitment in Indiana, which was disappointing, but understandable. He made up for it the following year.

Still, his fingerprints were on everything. Even in his absence, you could feel his presence: in the contours of every fairway, the placement of every bunker, the rhythm of the course itself. It was unmistakably Pete.

Despite the exhaustion, tension, and pouring rain, there was something electric in the air. The years of dreaming, planning, and persistence had brought us to this moment.

By midnight, the lights were still on in every corner of the clubhouse. The scent of grass hung in the rain. Boxes and ladders lined the hallways, and outside, the course lay quiet under a mist that made everything shimmer.

We were too wired to sleep — equal parts anxious and proud.

In just a few hours, the first carts would roll, the first ball would be struck, and fifteen long years after that fated handshake, Pete Dye Golf Club would come alive.
