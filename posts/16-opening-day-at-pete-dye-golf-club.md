*From the echoes of the coal mines to the sound of the first tee — the day the dream became real.*

There's no better place to begin. Pete saw something in this land long before the rest of us could: the drama, the contours, the story waiting to be told.

These exact words from Pete were those that I revisited in the early morning hours of Opening Day and shared with our staff before the festivities began.

Fifteen years of work, worry, and weather came down to this morning. I'd imagined it a thousand times: what it would look like, how it would feel, but no version ever matched the real thing.

This was a critical day in the club's history. You don't get a second chance to make a first impression.

And this was our time.

## The Morning

After no sleep, the staff reassembled and was ready to go by 7 a.m. Skies were clearing. Excitement was building. After a quick Bloody Mary toast, we were good to go.

The invocation at breakfast was delivered by Father Hilarion Cann and Monsignor John O'Reilly. Both golfers, both filled with wit and wisdom. Their words set a perfect tone for the day: reverent, lighthearted, and full of perspective.

Then it was my turn. Standing at the podium and looking out over the crowd, I was proud beyond words, but nervous as hell until I found my rhythm.

Next came Jim Jamieson, who, in his usual way, loosened everyone up within minutes. His humor, timing, and warmth carried the room. Our members then introduced themselves to one another, one by one. It was one of the proudest moments of the day: seeing the people who had believed in us, gathered together for the first time.

Later that evening, I'd have other profoundly moving moments. Standing with my family at the festivities, walking to the first tee with my dad. My emotions were all over the board. And in the back of my mind was one lingering question: after an inch of rain the day before, would the course hold up?

## The Land Beneath Our Feet

As we passed familiar landmarks, the air shaft by #2 tee, the deep mine water near #5, the mine opening on #6, and the highwall on #8, the history of this place came rushing back.

This was once coal country, and that legacy was still visible in every contour of the land. For me, it was impossible not to think about the miners who worked beneath it all, about the lives and labor that came before the fairways.

For a moment, golf felt secondary.

## The Evening

Pam and her team transformed the space. White linens. Her finest china and crystal. It was surreal. A scene of elegance and light set against the backdrop of coal country.

As members and their families arrived that evening, dressed in their Sunday best, I couldn't help but laugh to myself: what the hell did we get ourselves into?

Then, down the first fairway, came the sound of bagpipes.

The pipers walked across the tee toward the clubhouse, and the sight (and sound) took everyone by surprise. Members hadn't expected that level of ceremony, that kind of feeling.

As the music carried across the hills, the emotions began to swell. Fifteen years of planning and persistence seemed to rise up with those notes. The dream we'd been chasing for so long was suddenly real.

## The Early Believers

Opening Day wasn't perfect.

We had nine holes open, another load of sod still waiting, a fragile putting surface on #8, and two bunkers without sand.

And yet, our members came — from Columbus, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, Morgantown, Boston, and even Spelter. Their belief in us, and in Pete, was humbling.

A special thanks to P.B. Dye, who invited his friends and contacts to the club, helping us gain exposure throughout the region at a critical moment.

## The Press

We'd invited a few local media outlets to cover the opening, but the response was far greater than expected. Reporters came from far and wide.

Their coverage was kind, generous, and (to our surprise) instrumental in jumpstarting our membership development efforts outside the area.

## The Night

As the last embers from the firework celebration faded into the hills, I stood for a moment in the quiet. The lights from the clubhouse shimmered across the fairways, and it finally sank in: after fifteen years, the dream wasn't just a vision anymore. It was alive, underfoot, breathing with its own rhythm. For one night, we allowed ourselves to simply stand in it.

Tomorrow, the work would begin again.
