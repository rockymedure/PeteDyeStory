On the morning of Opening Day, before the first tee shot, we gathered as a team and as friends.

This short video captures those first introductions: the people who helped bring Pete Dye Golf Club to life.

Many of you will recognize familiar faces and voices. I hope it brings back good memories.

I'd love to hear your memories of this day in the comments below!
