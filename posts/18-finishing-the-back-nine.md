# Finishing the Back Nine at Pete Dye Golf Club

When long days, late nights, setbacks and Pete's perfectionism collided in the final stretch of building Pete Dye Golf Club.

## The Clock Was Ticking

By the time we turned our attention to the back nine, the clock was running faster than ever.

There was a mountain of work still left to do, and not much daylight to get it done.

We still had to finish grading and contouring six holes, install the remaining irrigation, blacktop the cart paths on both the front and back nines, plant bentgrass on the fairways, tees, and greens, and even build a few new tees Pete decided we "needed" on holes 15, 16, and 17.

We were also repairing the lake on 15, building the bridge on 10, finishing the greens mix on 14 and 17, and literally constructing the green on 18. It felt endless. But despite the exhaustion, there was an undeniable sense of purpose in the air. We were confident, committed, and laser-focused on getting across the finish line.

The best part: Pete himself was able to spend more consistent time on-site. His presence alone lifted the entire team.

Dick Psolla, our agronomist, aligned his schedule to ours, and Pete brought in another shaper, Bobby Zanko, to assist. And then there was our friend and member, Dave Alvarez, who, along with his crew, took on the task of constructing the bridge on #10 and a walk bridge on #18. Without Dave's expertise and ingenuity, I'm not sure it would have been completed in time. Thank you, David!

## Building a Membership Before the Back Nine was Completed

With only nine holes open, trying to attract members from across the country was a stretch. Our focus for the rest of the season was the local and regional markets — Clarksburg, Morgantown, Pittsburgh, Columbus. Jim Jamieson began inviting his contacts from further afield, but we knew national interest would come once the back nine was complete.

So, we got to work the old-fashioned way: by knocking on doors and shaking hands.

Once I was confident we could deliver the experience we'd been promising, Billy Pulice and I started pounding the pavement. At the same time, our members stepped up in a huge way: connecting us with friends, hosting small gatherings in their homes, inviting us to their clubs and charity tournaments.

The logo began to appear everywhere. It was hard to go anywhere — an airport, a barber shop, a restaurant, even a bar (Froggy's or the 1902 Landmark, especially) — without someone stopping to ask, "Hey, aren't you with that new Pete Dye course?"

Those conversations turned into momentum, and momentum turned into growth. Our membership expanded faster than we ever anticipated.

## The Economy Turns in Our Favor

Timing, for once, was on our side.

The economy was rebounding at just the right moment, and national interest (both individual and corporate) was beginning to rise.

As the season wound down, we restructured our financing and thought we were in the clear. But, as we'd soon find out, that was just the beginning of another story.

(More on that next week.)

## Traveling with Pete

One of the unexpected gifts of that season was the time I spent traveling with Pete. He took me under his wing, inviting me to join him for member-guest tournaments and events that, frankly, I never imagined I'd experience firsthand.

Playing alongside him at Crooked Stick, The Golf Club, Old Marsh, and Seminole was something I'll never forget.

At Seminole, we were paired with Bill Campbell and Billy Joe Patton the first two days — legends. I was so nervous, I could hardly pull the club back. But once I settled in, I realized how extraordinary those moments really were.

And then there was Casa de Campo in the winter of '94 with Pete, Dad and Joe DiMaggio. These travels taught me more about course presentation, hospitality, and design philosophy than any classroom ever could. The lessons from those travels would shape how I led our team moving forward.

## Pete's Perfection on 17

As we neared the final details, I remember Dad pleading with Pete to let him design the green on #17. Pete was amused and responded in the video below.

It was moments like this that remind me: this course wasn't just built. It was forged through collaboration, commitment, humor and passion.
