*Forgotten stories, final construction, and a surprise from Pete Dye that resurfaced just in time.*

Before we move into the long-awaited opening of our back nine with our second Member-Guest, I would be remiss not to revisit a few moments from 1993 that laid the foundation for what came next.

## A Night to Remember: Our First Member-Guest Dinner Dance (August 1993)

Before the bulldozers finished their last passes and before irrigation lines were fully in the ground, our growing community came together for our very first Member-Guest Dinner Dance — held at the Green Acres Supper Club.

Green Acres wasn't just any supper club. In the 1940s it was a clubhouse attached to a nine-hole golf course, and from the mid-1950s through the 1970s it was owned and operated by our family as a fine dining restaurant and piano bar. Returning there for our inaugural Member-Guest felt like a homecoming.

About 175 people attended that night. Leigh and I hosted our dear friends Ed and Sara Aman, who ultimately joined the club and remain members today. We even share grandchildren now.

It was a spectacular evening. The first of what became a twenty-year run of Member-Guest tournaments that grew into our premiere event.

## Pete's Forgotten Masterpiece

Just before we opened the back nine, Ron Braddock arrived with something remarkable: a diagram Pete had drawn years earlier: not on a napkin, or the back of a scorecard, but on an airline air sickness bag.

Ron had been seated next to Pete on a commuter flight. At the time, he didn't even know a course was being built in our area. Pete, being Pete, sketched the routing right then and there. While he was famous for these spontaneous drawings, this was the only one he ever did on an air sick bag.

He saved it. Protected it. And presented it to my dad just before the back nine opened.

After seventeen years of work, that simple sketch suddenly felt like a small miracle.

## The Club Coat

Every club of true distinction has a signature coat, and we had ours.

In the early years, we presented it to new members upon joining. Later, we offered them exclusively for purchase by members. Seeing a room full of those embroidered coats at Member-Guest events was incredibly gratifying. It felt like a symbol that we'd arrived.

## The Lodge: A Home for Our Members

Our construction crew handled the foundation for the lodge, but as deadlines tightened, time became our biggest enemy. So we pivoted and had the building pre-fabricated and delivered to the property.

In just a few short weeks, it was fully assembled and ready.

On opening day, it stood complete.

Sleeping sixteen people under one roof might not sound extraordinary today, but back then it was essential. It allowed national members, corporate groups, and friends of the club to stay on property — deepening their connection to the land and to each other.

## Growing the Golf Staff

During this period, our golf staff began to grow as well. I won't get every year exactly right, but you'll meet them as the story unfolds. What I remember most is their pride: not just in their work, but in representing West Virginia to members and guests from around the country.

Their hospitality was unmatched. They were the heartbeat of the club.

And I couldn't have been prouder.

## The Final Construction Push

By mid-August, the finish line was finally visible.

Pete made a few late adjustments, nothing we couldn't handle, but the biggest remaining task was completing the irrigation system and getting water running across the back nine.

It was all hands on deck. Weeks of trenching, connecting, fine-tuning.

And then one afternoon, we turned the system on.

It worked.

After everything we had faced, the setbacks, the storms, the delays, that moment felt like a victory in itself.

Looking back, it's clear that the months leading up to our back-nine opening weren't just about construction, schedules, or logistics. They were about people. The friends who showed up, the staff who believed in the vision, the members who celebrated with us long before the course was finished, and the small miracles like Pete's air-sick-bag sketch that reminded us why we were doing this in the first place.

Those moments in 1993 quietly built the soul of the club. Not the grass, not the irrigation, not the buildings - the heartbeat.

So by the time the irrigation finally kicked on and water flowed across the back nine, it wasn't just proof that the course was nearly ready.

It was a sign that we were ready.

Ready for the next chapter. Ready for the long-awaited opening of all 18 holes. Ready to welcome the world to something we had poured nearly two decades into.
