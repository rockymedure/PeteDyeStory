*How 1994–95 Became the Turning Point for the Pete Dye Golf Club*

As I began looking back over the 1994 season, one truth rose above everything else: by that point, we had assembled an extraordinary pool of talent in every corner of the operation. That single fact was critical in creating the atmosphere of a national golf club. One that would meet the expectations of the members who had trusted us with their time, their families, and their memories.

It wasn't just the obvious names, though Jim Jamieson, Bill Stines, and the golf staff they built certainly set the tone. It was also Gary Grandstaff, Craig Fortner, and their maintenance team, whose early-morning dedication shaped the course into something worthy of Pete's imagination. And then there were the people behind the scenes: Billy Pulice, Alexis Cava, and Pam Iaquinta—who carried our marketing, administration, and food and beverage operations far beyond anything we expected. And with Donna Mitchell and Jay Davis coming on board, our roster was complete.

If there was a single lesson from that season, it wasn't about bunkers or budgets. It was about each other. About learning what we all needed to bring, individually and collectively, to create the quintessential experience for members and their guests who came to our mountain retreat.

Our family's deepest gratitude goes to them all.

## The Clubhouse We Outgrew Overnight

The success and exposure we gained in 1994 came fast, much faster than any of us anticipated. And with that momentum came a hard truth: even with only nine holes open for most of the year, we simply didn't have the infrastructure to support the level of activity.

We needed more room. More capability. More of everything.

With the help of local architect Bob Pernell, plans were drawn for a greatly improved facility. The new building incorporated our original double-wide, added a deck overlooking the 9th green, and included expanded spaces for the golf shop, restaurant, and kitchen.

Plans were finalized. Construction began. And not a minute too soon. Opening day for the 1995 season was only months away.

## The 1995 PGA Show: Realizing the Industry Was Watching

In January, Bill, Billy, and I traveled to Orlando for the PGA Show. By then, word was spreading fast that all 18 holes were finally open and that the course was something special.

What none of us fully appreciated until we stepped onto the show floor was just how influential Bill Stines had become in the industry. We couldn't walk 50 feet before someone stopped him (or recognized our logo) and wanted to talk about the course.

We had contacts from the previous year, but this time felt different. This time the confidence followed us home.

## A Trip to Remember

After the show, Pete, Joe DiMaggio, Dad, and I traveled to Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic. Even now, it feels surreal to say that sentence out loud.

Pete was a cult hero there. His design, Teeth of the Dog, had revitalized the economy and transformed the region. Locals recognized him instantly. They'd walk right up to his Model T, wave, shout their thanks, grateful for how he had changed their community.

Then there was Joe DiMaggio.

In a baseball-crazed nation, he wasn't just a celebrity. He was royalty. Whether we were walking through town, attending a Santana concert, or watching a ballgame, people gravitated to him. And both Pete and Joe were proudly wearing the Pete Dye Golf Club logo everywhere they went. I promise you, that didn't hurt our cause.

At times, Dad and I felt like the third wheels…and we were. But they were so gracious, so welcoming, that it never once felt uncomfortable.

After visiting the two new courses Pete was building at the resort, we packed our bags and headed back home.

For a couple of coal miners from central West Virginia, it was the trip of a lifetime.

## National Attention Arrives

As we prepared for our long-awaited Grand Opening, we received two pieces of news that seemed almost too good to be true.

First, the USGA notified us that our second hole was being selected as one of the Top 500 golf holes in the world.

Then we learned that the book Bury Me in a Pot Bunker was about to be released: featuring Pete's work, his philosophy, and the role our club played in his career. And that the author Mark Shaw would be unveiling the book at our Grand Opening.

For the club, the timing couldn't have been more perfect.

## Planning the Grand Opening of a Lifetime

Once we confirmed that Pete and Alice would attend the celebration, I set the date: July 4, 1995.

And then the commitments started rolling in.

Joe DiMaggio. Two governors. Two congressmen. A U.S. senator. A book author. Business leaders from across central West Virginia. Multiple golf publications and newspapers.

With that level of attention, the stakes were sky-high. From course conditions to food service, from security to fireworks, the event had to be flawless.

This was our moment to show the world exactly what Pete Dye Golf Club had become.

In preparation, our maintenance staff expanded to nearly 30 people. Pete's courses have never been inexpensive to maintain, and now we had the manpower and experience to get our arms around the budget and the standards that we set for ourselves.

And so, with a new clubhouse, a fully opened championship course, a veteran team, and the eyes of the industry watching…

The planning for the 1995 Grand Opening had officially begun.

What happens next is one for the books.
