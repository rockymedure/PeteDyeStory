*The Final Push Toward Our Grand Opening at the Pete Dye Golf Club*

The club opened for the 1995 season in early April. Winter had been relatively kind to the course. There were no obvious signs of serious damage, but there were still areas of disrepair that demanded attention. We knew exactly what lay ahead.

Our Grand Opening was less than ninety days away.

Despite the pressure, the operation was hitting on all cylinders. There was a shared understanding among the staff that this was the final stretch, the moment where preparation would meet opportunity.

## The Course Takes Center Stage

With the maintenance crew now at full capacity, our focus shifted entirely to grow-in, improved playing conditions, and finishing what had been left undone. Gary had developed strong relationships with several agronomy schools, and the interns who joined us became an invaluable part of the team.

Momentum was everywhere.

Our sod farm was completed.

New maintenance equipment began arriving.

The pump station was finished.

Areas of disrepair were corrected.

Renovations to the maintenance building were wrapped up.

At the same time, Pete, along with our agronomist Dick Psolla and his son Eric, made multiple trips to the club to evaluate course conditions and discuss long-term maintenance practices.

It quickly became clear that course conditioning was of the utmost importance to Pete.

During his early 1995 visits, we barely saw him. Pete spent nearly all of his time with Gary and the maintenance staff out on the course: walking, observing, and sharing his expectations for how his namesake would be cared for.

Pete took a keen interest in how Gary approached the responsibility of maintaining one of his designs.

When we made the decision to install bent grass on fairways, greens, and tees, we knew the club sat squarely in a transition zone. While there were several bent grass varieties available, we were all learning in real time—evaluating performance, resilience, and playability as the season unfolded.

## Key Additions to the Team

That spring, two important additions joined our staff: Donna Mitchell in golf operations and Jay Davis in food and beverage.

Their personalities, enthusiasm, and commitment aligned perfectly with the culture we were building. From day one, their presence felt like a natural fit—not just for the season ahead, but for many years to come.

At the same time, Bill Stines began implementing a formal caddie program. Proper vetting. Proper training. Proper expectations.

The caddies' white uniforms, paired with their energy and professionalism, added a new layer of atmosphere to the club. It wasn't just about service. It was about tradition, pride, and creating an experience that felt unmistakably special.

## Membership Beyond Expectations

By the time our Grand Opening arrived, we had accepted nearly 300 members from 15 states and three countries, spanning both corporate and national classifications. Our resident classification filled quickly and was officially closed, even as demand continued to grow.

What made this achievement truly exceptional was how it happened.

We weren't a real-estate-driven development.

We didn't employ a membership development company.

And we had only realistically operated with all 18 holes open for about three months.

Every member came through relationships. Through the people who represented the club. Our members, our golf staff, our management team, and our friends all played a role.

It was an entirely in-house effort, and we were incredibly proud of it.

Early ambassadors and friends we considered family included Don Baldini, Tom Aman, Pat Kelly, Ed Aman, Pete Kaites, Louie Bonasso, Bob Haden, Chris Kerr, and Matt Harki.

## The Final Days Before Opening

As it always goes, no matter how prepared you are, the days leading up to an event like this never feel quite ready.

We were juggling last-minute tenting issues, guest lists, security, and helicopter arrivals. Pete and Alice's accommodations had to be perfect. Every day seemed to introduce something new that demanded attention.

We scheduled the celebration for a Saturday, with golf planned for Sunday, adding an extra layer of anticipation and energy.

As the day approached, there was a mix of excitement, trepidation, and enthusiasm that's hard to describe unless you've lived it.

The course was ready.

The staff was ready.

The golf world was watching.

And with that, we stood on the edge of the biggest day in the club's young history.
