*A note of gratitude, a short break, and a preview of the stories we'll share next.*

As we turn our attention to the Christmas season and the New Year, I want to take a moment to thank you for allowing me to share our story with you.

This has been an incredible adventure, one I'm grateful to relive and continue sharing. Writing these posts has brought back memories I hadn't visited in years, and it has meant a lot knowing you've been along for the ride.

Many of you have asked how long the story will go on.

We will be continuing into the New Year, but we'll be taking a short break until Sunday, January 11, when we begin covering the club's story beyond the Grand Opening.

That next chapter will include:

- The club's growth, notoriety, and membership development
- More stories about our staff — and their experiences behind the scenes
- The ever-changing golf economy
- The opening of our permanent clubhouse
- The Nationwide Golf Tournament
- More Pete Dye moments (always)
- And plenty more along the way

For members, I hope these posts unlock a few of your own memories, bringing back experiences with the club and our staff, and hopefully a few laughs and smiles during your visits.

I also know our staff is looking forward to sharing their memories too… (maybe not all of them)

Thank you again for reading, sharing, and participating in this incredible journey with me.

We'll continue the story on Sunday, January 11.

In the meantime, I wish you and your loved ones a holiday season filled with warmth, joy, and time well spent together. I look forward to continuing to share our passion with you in the New Year.

Cheers,  
Jimmy & Family
