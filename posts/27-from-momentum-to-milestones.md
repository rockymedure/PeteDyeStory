*Rankings, growth, lodging, and hosting the WV State Amateur in the late 1990's.*

By the mid to late 1990s, you could feel it everywhere. The economy was rebounding, the real estate market was strong, and golf activity was surging. Tiger Woods' popularity brought new eyes to the game and real estate growth was expanding across the entire industry. More people were playing, more clubs were expanding, and interest in "destination golf" was climbing.

At the time, it felt like we were riding a wave. But looking back, that wave also set the stage for some difficult years for golf in the early to mid 2000s. For now though, in the late 90s, we were in a season of momentum. Membership was growing. Rounds were up. And with that growth came a simple reality:

If we wanted to compete with the best national clubs, we had to build an experience that matched the course.

## Recognition and Rankings

As the club continued to mature, we began receiving increased recognition - rankings from Golf Digest, Golfweek, and others. It was exciting, but it also raised a question that eventually became hard to ignore:

We weren't seeing many of the people who actually do the ranking visiting the course.

After talking it through with Pete, it became clear he did not like the "dog-and-pony show" approach of hosting ranking committees.

Pete's preference was simple: let the course stand on its own. No spectacle. No polishing it up for a committee.

Shortly after that conversation, Pete made a few strategic calls to friends in the industry and, almost overnight, we started seeing visits from ranking committee members.

Those visits led to rankings that placed the course among the elite.

## Expanding the Experience

I'll be honest, I never envisioned needing to build lodging or a third clubhouse so quickly.

But the growth was real. With membership development and the rising level of activity, it became evident that if we wanted to compete with other national golf clubs for members, we needed to "complete the experience."

After consulting with Pete, we selected an area past the clubhouse for the development of corporate lodges and townhouses. At one point, we could lodge up to approximately 100 members and guests.

The new clubhouse also became a priority. It wasn't until Johnny Aman and I were sitting there, drinking a couple cold beers and talking it through, that we realized the solution was moving the site to where it is now. By putting an angle in the building layout, the current site suddenly worked perfectly — with views down the 18th fairway.

Thanks, Johnny.

## Our Signature Events

As the club grew, our events grew with it. Two of them quickly became signature experiences:

### The Member-Guest

Our Member-Guest tournaments expanded to two events per year, drawing members and their friends from across the country. They weren't just tournaments, they became annual reunions.

Our caddy program, built and strengthened through the efforts of Bill Stines, John Rappold, and others, was never more on display than during these tournaments.

### The West Virginia State Amateur

Hosting the WV State Amateur was an honor. After meeting with Pete and Bill Campbell, I agreed.

The tournament was a success. We had multiple members qualify to play. Member participation was strong. And we gained statewide recognition from golfers who had never been here before.

Pat Carter won the Championship again.

Looking back, the late 90's were the years when everything started to stack: recognition, membership, activity, events, and the beginnings of an expanded campus. We weren't just maintaining a great course anymore. We were building a place people traveled to, stayed at, and remembered.
