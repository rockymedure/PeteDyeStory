# When the Tournament Became a Tradition

*The late 90's brought traditions, unforgettable characters, and the kind of energy you could feel from the first tee to the clubhouse glass.*

There are certain moments in a club's life when you realize you're not just hosting events anymore, you're building a culture.

For us, in the late 90's, that moment had a name:

**The Member Guest.**

It started with competition. A full tee sheet, plenty of pride, and that special kind of nervous energy you only get when people care. But it didn't take long to realize the tournament wasn't becoming popular because of the format.

It was becoming popular because of the *people.*

There was real camaraderie. The kind you can't manufacture. The kind where a guest shows up as a visitor and leaves feeling like a member.

Traditions seemed to appear out of thin air and quickly became non-negotiable. **The Simpson Creek Challenge**, for one. No matter how serious the competition got, there was always room for fun (and certainly a little chaos).

And then there were the details that made the whole weekend feel like something bigger than golf:

Kevin Dawson showing up with magic and somehow becoming part of the fabric of the event.

Chris and Donny Davidson providing the soundtrack through dinners, laughs, and late nights.

And George Ramirez (Mya Cigars) with cigar rolling that made it feel like you'd stepped into another era.

Even the guest list carried its own lore. Over the years we had sports celebrities join in — Mario Lemieux, Steve Spurrier, Jackie Nicklaus, John Kruk, and others who returned more than once. They didn't come back because the trophies were bigger.

They came back because the weekend felt alive.

## Kurt Skasik

But if you ask me one of the things that I remember most, it isn't a scorecard.

It's Kurt Skasik.

Kurt had a way of taking a tournament and turning it into an experience. He never failed to elevate the weekend — and anyone who was there knows exactly what I mean.

He had that infectious smile, and that Kurt quality where he always seemed to be "dealing with a situation" (usually self-created) and somehow doing it with so much charm you couldn't help but laugh. He was loyal, unforgettable, and one of those people who could shift the atmosphere of an entire room just by walking into it.

During Member Guest weekend, Kurt wasn't just participating: he was *performing*, in the best possible way.

*You will always be remembered, my friend.*

## Building the Clubhouse

Here's what's funny about that period: while the club was creating these bigger and bigger weekends, we were also facing a truth behind the scenes.

If we were going to keep growing, we needed a clubhouse that could carry what we were becoming.

I contacted my friends at Omni Associates (Steve Barnum and Richard Forren) and Phil Weeser of March Westin Construction Company.

John Rappold and I went on a fact-finding mission, visiting as many clubs as we could. Not just for inspiration, but to learn what worked (and what definitely didn't).

When we returned, the team assembled, plans were finalized, and construction began.

The course took us **18 years.**

The clubhouse took about **a year and a half.**

My friend Steve Barnum put up with all my input: graciously accepted it, corrected me, and humored me through the process. He helped make it a great experience and a great clubhouse.

*Thank you, Steve.*

## The 2000 WV Open

After hosting the State Amateur, we made the decision to host the **2000 WV Open**.

The tournament had been held for **66 consecutive years**. Tradition mattered to us.

**Sam Snead** had won it **17 times**, including **1957**, when he finished ahead of second-place finisher…our very own **Mike Krak.**

### An Unforgettable Hometown Run

And then, as if the weekend needed another layer of electricity, our very own **Steve Shrawder** put himself in the mix.

On the final day, Steve turned the front nine at **two-under** and suddenly he was in contention. With **Johnny "Ballgame" Shields** on the bag, they were officially in the hunt.

On **#18**, Steve's second shot finished about **25 feet** from the flag. Ballgame read the line and told him to commit.

Everyone was watching.

The putt rolled and when it got to about **four feet** from the hole, Ballgame shouted:

**"Pick it up!"**

And then it dropped.

The place erupted. Members shouting, pounding on the glass. One of those moments you never forget because you can still feel it years later.

**Brad Westfall** went on to win. But that weekend gave us something that mattered just as much as the final score:

It gave us *legends.*

It gave us *stories.*

It gave us that shared feeling that we were stepping into something bigger than ourselves.
