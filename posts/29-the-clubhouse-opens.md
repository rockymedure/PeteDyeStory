# The Clubhouse Opens

*The night everything changed — and the club finally caught up to the course.*

As we approached the opening of the clubhouse, the anticipation started to feel physical. Our entire staff was holding our breath.

Pete had committed to being there. Our lodging was booked with members and friends coming in for the occasion. Food and beverage operations were ready. Bagpipers were going to be in attendance. And the mood around the property was becoming totally festive and filled with good vibes.

During construction, we gave what had to be a couple hundred walking tours of the facility. It was exciting to show everyone the layout and describe what it would become and to see their reactions.

But nothing prepared me for the impact the opening had on the club.

## A Walk Down 18

As the ceremony began with the bagpipers walking down the 18th fairway, an immense feeling of pride and excitement swept through everyone in attendance. It wasn't just that the building was beautiful, it was what it meant.

For the first time, it felt like we could adequately complement the course — a course that deserved it.

And watching Pete that evening, you could feel his pride as well. He greeted people, talked, laughed, took it all in. It was as though we had arrived…again.

Our architect, Steve Barnum, has always said it best and he shared a story about Pete that captures that moment:

> "The clubhouse opening at the Pete Dye Golf Club was in full swing. There were speeches, handshakes, polite applause, and the usual ceremonial back-patting that comes with cutting a ribbon on a brand-new building perched confidently on a West Virginia hillside.
>
> At some point during the festivities, Pete Dye, legendary course architect and professional mischief-maker, casually drifted over to me. He didn't do it publicly. Pete never did anything publicly if it could be done quietly and with greater effect.
>
> He gently hooked an arm through mine and steered me a few steps away from the crowd, lowering his voice the way people do when they're about to ask either a very serious question or make a very good joke. I was never entirely sure which one Pete preferred.
>
> He looked me straight in the eye, paused just long enough to be uncomfortable, and said, 'Steve, I just want to ask you one thing.'
>
> Now, keep in mind, this was the same time the 10th tee, not far away, was in the middle of slowly migrating downhill toward the creek, one rainstorm at a time.
>
> Pete nodded his head toward the clubhouse, then back toward the hill, and asked, completely straight-faced, 'You're sure this thing isn't going to do what the 10th tee did, right? I'd hate to come back and find the bar halfway down Simpson Creek.'
>
> For a brief moment, I mentally reviewed every geotechnical report, retaining wall detail, and cubic yard of compacted fill we'd ever placed on that site. Then I remembered who I was talking to.
>
> I told him, 'Pete, if the clubhouse starts moving, I promise you'll hear about it before the bartender does.'
>
> He smiled, gave a satisfied nod, and wandered back into the crowd, leaving me standing there wondering whether I'd just passed a structural integrity test or survived a perfectly delivered Pete Dye joke.
>
> To this day, the clubhouse is still exactly where we left it. The 10th tee, on the other hand, continues to keep an eye on the creek."
>
> — Stephen (Steve) A. Barnum, Architect

Steve Barnum (Omni Design) and Phil Weeser (March Westin) both won the WV Architectural Design awards in 2001 for the Clubhouse.

It was a great evening and now the club, not just the course, was postured to be among the elite in the country.

## Golf Digest

Not long after the opening, we received news that felt like confirmation of what we'd all sensed:

Golf Digest, in a special issue, ranked the club among "The 50 Greatest Private Retreats in the United States."

More than 800 panelists participated. They voted based on their experiences — the accommodations, meals, wines and spirits, caddie programs, and overall service. To even make the ballot, a club had to meet at least one of these criteria:

- be on Golf Digest's America's Top 100 list,
- rank among the best in the state, or
- be a finalist in their Best New Courses survey.

We were all three.

We were ranked #42, in the company of names you don't mention lightly: Augusta, Pine Valley, Oakmont, Muirfield Village, Shoal Creek and Laurel Valley…and others that define what "best in the country" really means.

I think you'd agree: that's pretty impressive company.

## New Possibilities

The clubhouse didn't just give us a place to gather, it opened the door to hosting at a level we simply couldn't before.

It allowed us to entertain additional functions at the club, most notably Monday outings and eventually a PGA event.

And while there were several advantages to hosting these events, the most meaningful impact has always been what they did for our community.

From hospital charities to foundation fundraiser's, these events have raised literally millions of dollars over the years for causes that truly matter.

One of the most notable (and still going strong) is Medbrook Children's Charity.

Founded in 2000 and led by our good friend, Kelly Nelson, what started as a simple handshake between Kelly and I, a one-day golf event, has grown into a multi-day extravaganza, complete with ancillary social events spreading throughout the year. It has raised over 2 million dollars for children causes.

Were it not for the club and Kelly's foresight, commitment and perseverance, this opportunity would never have presented it self to the children or community.

Kelly, our hats are off to you for a job well done and for supporting those in need all of these years. Thank you.

## Tournament Whispers

With the addition of the clubhouse, we were finally postured to bring a large-scale event not only to the club, but to West Virginia.

One day at Old Marsh, while spending time with Pete and Alice, we began discussing potential opportunities, fully aware that hosting a tournament of national prominence would take years of waiting our turn — and that north-central West Virginia would present both advantages and drawbacks.

Tournaments discussed were the Walker Cup, US Amateur, US Mid Amateur, Solheim Cup and even beginning our own National Amateur event. It seemed that these styled events would fit our areas accommodations the best, at least initially.

However, before we could make much progress, I received a call from the State of West Virginia to explore whether we'd be interested in hosting a PGA event — which, at least temporarily, derailed our conversations about the other events listed above while I learned more about the details.

Much more in later posts on this topic.

## Looking Back

In a lot of ways, the clubhouse opening felt like a second beginning. The course had already earned its place, but on opening night, the club finally caught up to what the land and the golf deserved.

And what followed wasn't just more dinners or more events. It was more connection. More gatherings. More memories made in the same spirit the club was built on. And, unexpectedly, it became a platform to serve our community in a meaningful way. Raising money and awareness for causes that mattered, and giving people a reason to come together for something bigger than golf.

Looking back, that evening marked a shift: we went from building something special to sharing it. And in the weeks ahead, I'll tell you how one conversation about "what could be" eventually turned into something much larger than we could have ever anticipated.

## Another Honor

As we prepared for today's Substack edition, we became aware of yet another honor worth sharing. Links Magazine conducted a ranking of the Top 100 Courses in the U.S., as ranked by the Society of Architects from the United States, Europe, and Australia. The Pete Dye Golf Club is ranked 24th.

This places the course in the highest tier of American course design, alongside Oakmont, Pebble Beach, Pine Valley, Whistling Straits, Cypress Point, and Shinnecock (home of the 2026 U.S. Open). Of particular note, this is a ranking given by Pete's fellow designers from throughout the world.

Pete, we are honored to have your genius on full display here at this no longer abandoned coal mine.
