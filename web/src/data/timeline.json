A roll of fabric paper in the bunker base prevents mud from contaminating the cinders. He explains that seven large bunkers on No. 1 may each require about 20 tons of cinders. Harris Holt steps into the trap to test footing and ball lie, reporting that the cinders are quite soft; James speculates that rain and gravity may compact them over time. They discuss possibly mixing sand and cinders or going all-sand if playability is acceptable. This chapter captures the club\u2019s willingness to experiment with materials that echo the site\u2019s coal heritage.",

A bailout area short and left allows for an easier pitch if players choose safety over aggression.\nThe map zooms in on these holes, particularly highlighting the stone wall framing 14, the large lake on 15, and the dramatic downhill nature of 16, reinforcing the course\u2019s visual drama and strategic variety.",

The green is large enough to hold approach shots but is well bunkered.\n- Hole 18 (450-yard par 4, \u201cthe magnificent 18th\u201d): From an elevated tee, players drive across Simpson Creek, which borders the left side of the fairway. The second shot comes from an ample landing area, but players must favor the left side to have an open approach to the green. The right side is a contoured hillside designed to accommodate up to 30,000 spectators, explicitly evoking dreams of hosting major tournaments.\nThe narrator closes by stating that the vision of James LaRosa and the genius of Pete Dye have combined to create a unique opportunity in central West Virginia, and thanks viewers for sharing in the excitement. The final tone is aspirational, positioning the club as both a world-class golf experience and a potential major championship venue.",

    "summary": "Dr. Charles Jacobson delivers a detailed, slide\u2011supported talk on U.S. health care. He begins by acknowledging the complexity of the topic and joking about the political debate around health care and the Clintons. He stresses that health care has done \u2018absolutely profoundly wonderful things\u2019 for society but is now in crisis due to costs and access. Slides trace four historical drivers: individual freedom, a large country of small towns, employer\u2011based health insurance, and the creation of the National Institutes of Health. He explains how solo small\u2011town doctors were paid in kind, how employers in the 1940s used health insurance to retain workers, and how post\u2011WWII science (atomic bomb, air travel) led to NIH and explosive medical advances (pacemakers, bypass surgery, MRI, CAT scans, mammograms, transplants, artificial joints, cancer cures, modern hypertension and lipid drugs). Subsequent slides labeled \u20181995 Problems\u2019 outline issues: science driving costs, doctors overwhelmed by knowledge and working in disconnected \u2018cottage industry\u2019 practices without integrated records, and insurance companies controlling costs despite limited clinical knowledge. Jacobson uses a \u20181953 Corvette\u2019 analogy to illustrate the dysfunction of buying complex systems piecemeal with a third party paying the bills. He contrasts externally controlled systems (like national HMOs) with community\u2011built, internally controlled systems, arguing that communities should create integrated health\u2011care systems to keep control and profits local. He presents Minnesota\u2019s experience: merging Park Nicollet and Group Health, integrating hospitals, reducing redundant technology (CTs, surgery centers, cancer centers), standardizing best practices among 3,000 physicians (including Mayo Clinic), and achieving 20% lower costs with high quality (e.g., low cardiovascular mortality). He concludes that American health care, if allowed to experiment, can become the envy of the world and a major export, and urges local business leaders to help build integrated, patient\u2011focused systems rather than cede control to distant corporations.",

He notes that technology that \u2018bites us\u2019 on cost can also help if used properly (e.g., ambulatory information systems, guidelines at the point of care, medical records in patients\u2019 homes). He describes Minnesota\u2019s reductions in hospital beds and costs without sacrificing quality, and mentions Park Nicollet\u2019s low cardiovascular mortality. He outlines \u2018future drivers\u2019 of U.S. health care: individual rights, health vs. disease treatment, care systems vs. insurance systems, and human values vs. pure science. He expresses strong optimism that American medicine will innovate its way to being the envy of the world, with private enterprise exporting health\u2011care expertise. He references telemedicine and teleradiology as examples of emerging opportunities. Jacobson closes by stressing that \u2018it is your health care system, it is your community,\u2019 urging local businesspeople and citizens to create their own integrated systems rather than be controlled by distant entities like New York or L.A. The audience applauds, and the Chamber presents him with a \u2018low\u2011cost health\u2011care package\u2019 of West Virginia food products as a humorous thank\u2011you gift to take back to Carolina.",

    "summary": "After the keynote, the program moves into the recognition portion. Chamber President Gary Bowden (or another officer) invites the president, Gary Godwin/Bowden, to present the 1995 Harrison County Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year. The presenter reads an extensive citation describing the honoree: a loyal West Virginian, devoted Harrison Countian, and committed Clarksburger; graduate of Washington Irving High School and West Virginia University; successful coal businessman; former director of the Chamber, Lowndes Bank, and the WV Surface Mining and Reclamation Association; appointee to the WV Coal Commission; founder and former chairman of the WV Italian Heritage Festival. The honoree donated and built the WVU Hospital Medivac helipad and established a surgical research endowment. Numerous institutions\u2014Harrison County YMCA, Wheeling College, United Hospital Center, Clarksburg Library, Humane Society, youth sports leagues, Upshur County schools, Buckhannon Fire Department, Fraternal Order of Police, and the Statue of Liberty restoration fund\u2014are listed as beneficiaries of his generosity. Awards include a Doctor of Humane Letters from Salem College, nomination by Senator Byrd to the Presidential Christopher Columbus Quincentennial Jubilee Commission, Distinguished West Virginian honors from Governors Moore and Rockefeller, a Distinguished Service Award from the Clarksburg Arts Center, and an American Legion citation for support of baseball. The presenter then reveals that the Citizen of the Year is James D. LaRosa, noting that he built and developed East Point Shopping Center, recently finished the Pete Dye Championship Golf Course in Bridgeport, owns the Rose Garden Theater, and sold land for the WV Life Sciences Center and the future Robert C. Byrd High School. The audience gives a standing ovation. LaRosa comes to the podium, jokes that he won\u2019t touch the microphone, and gives a brief, humble speech: he has lived all his life within a couple of miles of his high school and considers himself a \u2018native son\u2019; he thanks the Chamber and hopes he has helped the quality of life for all; he credits his parents\u2019 love, support, and teaching for his success. The presenter calls the award \u2018well deserved, long overdue.\u2019",

He explains his background in big business and his realization, through Chamber work, that \u2018in West Virginia, small business is big business,\u2019 noting that about 70% of Chamber membership is small businesses (75 or fewer employees). He cites mission\u2011statement words\u2014growth, stability, commitment, recognition of product/services, and community association\u2014as criteria. He then describes the winning business without naming it at first: started in a small Glen Elk kitchen by a woman preparing peppers for her corner grocery; production grew from 65 bushels in two weeks to over 600 bushels in one day; expanded from the grocery kitchen to a large modern facility on Stiles Street (\u2018the Pepper Plant\u2019) and a new administrative building on Ohio Avenue; workforce grew to 35\u201340 employees, more during peak canning; three generations of family involvement; major commitment to expansion announced the previous summer; products now on shelves across West Virginia and up and down the Atlantic seaboard, shipping to every state in the continental U.S. He then reveals the honoree: Oliverio\u2019s Italian Style Peppers. Quoting Frank Oliverio about wanting to always do a job they can be proud of, Barnes praises the family and calls them an outstanding promotion for Harrison County. Frank and Mark Oliverio come up to accept; they modestly say neither is a speaker and simply thank the Chamber before returning to their seats. Barnes jokes that Frank hopes he doesn\u2019t have to go back and cut peppers and \u2018cut his finger off the way you said that.\u2019",

The recipient must be dedicated, willing to give time and effort to represent the Chamber. This year\u2019s honoree is a retired gentleman who travels a lot but still makes special efforts to attend events. Barnes jokes that when people saw him and another man (Brett) in purple jackets, they might think they got a deal at Gabriel\u2019s, but the jackets signify their role as Chamber ambassadors. He announces the Ambassador of the Year for 1995 as Mr. John Lowe (or Love), who comes forward wearing the same purple jacket. After this, Barnes notes that the program is at its end, thanks Walt Williams, Frank Abruzzini, and office staff for organizing the event, and encourages members to get involved in Chamber committees listed on the back of the program. He invites people to stop by the Chamber office at 348 West Main Street, promising coffee, candy from Mary Beth, or a smile from Madeline. He emphasizes that without members\u2019 support and involvement, the Chamber is nothing, and closes with wishes for a safe trip home and \u2018we\u2019ll see you next year.\u2019 The tape ends with an Ellis Productions title card crediting Louis P.
