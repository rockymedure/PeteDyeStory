The Sheriff formally introduces \u2018the great Willie Mosconi\u2019 and notes he played Willie 35 years ago and that Willie \u2018hasn\u2019t slowed down.\u2019 Willie himself speaks briefly, joking that the Sheriff is no different now than decades ago. James D. then addresses the room, saying he\u2019s thrilled his Florida friends come every year and teasing that next year he might have to charge them because the club will be open for business. He challenges Willie to a pool game at his son\u2019s house and says he\u2019s backing his friend Steve, who once wanted to be the next Willie Mosconi but became a coal miner instead. James D. invites everyone to his son\u2019s house for a \u2018two\u2011minute exhibition\u2019 by Willie, with the only rule being no smoking because his daughter\u2011in\u2011law just had a baby. He jokes about riding with the mayor and tickets costing five dollars. The segment ends with a toast of \u2018bon app\u00e9tit\u2019 and more of Frank\u2019s humorous storytelling about priests, Ireland, and his time in an orphanage.",

    "summary": "Archival footage from August 1985 documents early construction at the future Pete Dye Golf Club, focused on dredging and reshaping Simpson Creek and adjacent hillsides. Jimmy LaRosa (on camera and in voiceover) explains how end loaders, backhoes, scrapers, and multiple bulldozers remove decades of sediment, debris, and mine\u2011polluted water, then reuse the material to soften steep banks, build walls, and prepare sod farms. The footage also shows blasting out old bridge abutments and rock humps, loading shot rock into trucks, towing loaded trucks out of the riverbed with a D6 dozer, and planning for navigable water, boating, fishing, and future golf holes (notably the 18th and 5th). Jimmy repeatedly ties the heavy work to long\u2011term design goals\u2014natural\u2011looking, mowable slopes, dramatic water hazards, and a clubhouse overlooking the river\u2014while Louie Ellis films and occasionally appears on audio as the informal documentarian.",

He also shows rock recently placed along the entrance road and explains an experiment to build a rock wall there using the same stone as around the 18th green and lakes. Across the river, Tom Langston brush\u2011hogs tall weeds so Pete Dye can see the true ground contours for final fairway subtleties. Jimmy notes a shallow natural ford used for six years to cross the river and an orange\u2011flagged stake marking the future water level at 4.5 feet depth for boating.

        "summary": "Dr. Charles Jacobson delivers a detailed, slide\u2011supported talk on U.S. health care. He begins by acknowledging the complexity of the topic and joking about the political debate around health care and the Clintons. He stresses that health care has done \u2018absolutely profoundly wonderful things\u2019 for society but is now in crisis due to costs and access. Slides trace four historical drivers: individual freedom, a large country of small towns, employer\u2011based health insurance, and the creation of the National Institutes of Health. He explains how solo small\u2011town doctors were paid in kind, how employers in the 1940s used health insurance to retain workers, and how post\u2011WWII science (atomic bomb, air travel) led to NIH and explosive medical advances (pacemakers, bypass surgery, MRI, CAT scans, mammograms, transplants, artificial joints, cancer cures, modern hypertension and lipid drugs). Subsequent slides labeled \u20181995 Problems\u2019 outline issues: science driving costs, doctors overwhelmed by knowledge and working in disconnected \u2018cottage industry\u2019 practices without integrated records, and insurance companies controlling costs despite limited clinical knowledge. Jacobson uses a \u20181953 Corvette\u2019 analogy to illustrate the dysfunction of buying complex systems piecemeal with a third party paying the bills. He contrasts externally controlled systems (like national HMOs) with community\u2011built, internally controlled systems, arguing that communities should create integrated health\u2011care systems to keep control and profits local. He presents Minnesota\u2019s experience: merging Park Nicollet and Group Health, integrating hospitals, reducing redundant technology (CTs, surgery centers, cancer centers), standardizing best practices among 3,000 physicians (including Mayo Clinic), and achieving 20% lower costs with high quality (e.g., low cardiovascular mortality). He concludes that American health care, if allowed to experiment, can become the envy of the world and a major export, and urges local business leaders to help build integrated, patient\u2011focused systems rather than cede control to distant corporations.",

        "summary": "In the latter part of his talk, Dr. Jacobson discusses the need for integrated systems, robust information technology, and a shift from disease treatment to health promotion. He notes that technology that \u2018bites us\u2019 on cost can also help if used properly (e.g., ambulatory information systems, guidelines at the point of care, medical records in patients\u2019 homes). He describes Minnesota\u2019s reductions in hospital beds and costs without sacrificing quality, and mentions Park Nicollet\u2019s low cardiovascular mortality. He outlines \u2018future drivers\u2019 of U.S. health care: individual rights, health vs. disease treatment, care systems vs. insurance systems, and human values vs. pure science. He expresses strong optimism that American medicine will innovate its way to being the envy of the world, with private enterprise exporting health\u2011care expertise. He references telemedicine and teleradiology as examples of emerging opportunities. Jacobson closes by stressing that \u2018it is your health care system, it is your community,\u2019 urging local businesspeople and citizens to create their own integrated systems rather than be controlled by distant entities like New York or L.A. The audience applauds, and the Chamber presents him with a \u2018low\u2011cost health\u2011care package\u2019 of West Virginia food products as a humorous thank\u2011you gift to take back to Carolina.",

The honoree donated and built the WVU Hospital Medivac helipad and established a surgical research endowment. Numerous institutions\u2014Harrison County YMCA, Wheeling College, United Hospital Center, Clarksburg Library, Humane Society, youth sports leagues, Upshur County schools, Buckhannon Fire Department, Fraternal Order of Police, and the Statue of Liberty restoration fund\u2014are listed as beneficiaries of his generosity. Awards include a Doctor of Humane Letters from Salem College, nomination by Senator Byrd to the Presidential Christopher Columbus Quincentennial Jubilee Commission, Distinguished West Virginian honors from Governors Moore and Rockefeller, a Distinguished Service Award from the Clarksburg Arts Center, and an American Legion citation for support of baseball. The presenter then reveals that the Citizen of the Year is James D. LaRosa, noting that he built and developed East Point Shopping Center, recently finished the Pete Dye Championship Golf Course in Bridgeport, owns the Rose Garden Theater, and sold land for the WV Life Sciences Center and the future Robert C. Byrd High School. The audience gives a standing ovation. LaRosa comes to the podium, jokes that he won\u2019t touch the microphone, and gives a brief, humble speech: he has lived all his life within a couple of miles of his high school and considers himself a \u2018native son\u2019; he thanks the Chamber and hopes he has helped the quality of life for all; he credits his parents\u2019 love, support, and teaching for his success.

He explains his background in big business and his realization, through Chamber work, that \u2018in West Virginia, small business is big business,\u2019 noting that about 70% of Chamber membership is small businesses (75 or fewer employees). He cites mission\u2011statement words\u2014growth, stability, commitment, recognition of product/services, and community association\u2014as criteria. He then describes the winning business without naming it at first: started in a small Glen Elk kitchen by a woman preparing peppers for her corner grocery; production grew from 65 bushels in two weeks to over 600 bushels in one day; expanded from the grocery kitchen to a large modern facility on Stiles Street (\u2018the Pepper Plant\u2019) and a new administrative building on Ohio Avenue; workforce grew to 35\u201340 employees, more during peak canning; three generations of family involvement; major commitment to expansion announced the previous summer; products now on shelves across West Virginia and up and down the Atlantic seaboard, shipping to every state in the continental U.S. He then reveals the honoree: Oliverio\u2019s Italian Style Peppers. Quoting Frank Oliverio about wanting to always do a job they can be proud of, Barnes praises the family and calls them an outstanding promotion for Harrison County. Frank and Mark Oliverio come up to accept; they modestly say neither is a speaker and simply thank the Chamber before returning to their seats.

He explains that the award goes to the person who best exemplifies the Chamber\u2019s role in the community\u2014visible at most Chamber functions (open houses, ribbon cuttings, business after hours, dedications, groundbreakings, and any event drawing two or more people). The recipient must be dedicated, willing to give time and effort to represent the Chamber. This year\u2019s honoree is a retired gentleman who travels a lot but still makes special efforts to attend events. Barnes jokes that when people saw him and another man (Brett) in purple jackets, they might think they got a deal at Gabriel\u2019s, but the jackets signify their role as Chamber ambassadors. He announces the Ambassador of the Year for 1995 as Mr. John Lowe (or Love), who comes forward wearing the same purple jacket. After this, Barnes notes that the program is at its end, thanks Walt Williams, Frank Abruzzini, and office staff for organizing the event, and encourages members to get involved in Chamber committees listed on the back of the program. He invites people to stop by the Chamber office at 348 West Main Street, promising coffee, candy from Mary Beth, or a smile from Madeline. He emphasizes that without members\u2019 support and involvement, the Chamber is nothing, and closes with wishes for a safe trip home and \u2018we\u2019ll see you next year.\u2019 The tape ends with an Ellis Productions title card crediting Louis P.

Cameraman/narrator Louis (Louie) Ellis informally interviews Pete Dye, James D. LaRosa, Jimmy (Jimmy Joe) LaRosa, and key staff while they stand on raw dirt fairways and around heavy equipment. Pete delivers a long, humorous anecdote about playing a heavily guarded fundraising round with President Bill Clinton, then shifts into a thoughtful mini-lecture on how golf courses must evolve over time. Jimmy introduces the professional staff and construction crew (including Bill Stines, Gary Grandstaff, Keith \u201cSparky\u201d Sparkman, shaper Mike Langkau, and Director of Golf Jim Jamieson). The piece closes with James D. and Jimmy reflecting on the project\u2019s meaning and future, and Louie Ellis giving his trademark \u201cno charge\u201d sign-off.

Director of Golf Jim Jamieson is formally introduced and explains the day\u2019s format and handicap system. Members introduce themselves one\u2011by\u2011one, then head to the course, where Louie Ellis and friends film James D. and \u201cJJ\u201d hitting their first shots on their own course. Later sequences show a lakeside opening dinner with bagpipers, fireworks on July 3, 1993, and intimate family/clubhouse moments. The footage captures the transition from a 15\u2011year dream to a functioning, member\u2011driven club and documents the early culture, humor, and community around the LaRosa\u2013Dye project.",

On October 16, they show the #1 fairway, already soft and lush despite its short life, and the #1 green ready for seeding. Harris points out the color differences between fairway, rough, and fringes, and notes #4 lake in the background. They then film the landing area of #2, remarking how magnificently the fairways have come up and recalling when the bank had to be sodded. From the #5 tee, Harris explains it\u2019s a dogleg right and the only true par\u20115; no one can reach it in two. He describes its three levels and shows early grass just emerging. From near #7 green, they look back over #5 from an elevated vantage, noting how green everything has become in just a week. They stop to film fresh deer tracks as a curiosity. On #6, they show the mine portal and stone wall separating rough from fairway, recalling earlier photos of Louie and Pete Dye there. They also film #4 (a short par\u20113 over the lake), #3 (a slight dogleg right with a large waste bunker), and #9 tee, which offers a dramatic view down to Simpson Creek and a fairway lined with reclaimed trees. Harris repeatedly emphasizes the professionalism of the construction team and the speed of turf establishment.",

He notes that the topsoil from that deposit is used around the course, while the sand is washed and blended on site to USGA specs. He points out the two different grasses on the fairways, visible by color. The tees will be seeded that night or the next day, completing #1. The camera then moves to #3 green under construction: trucks back in with sand/peat mix, which is spread by a Pete Dye shaper on a Case dozer. Harris explains that the sand layer is 8\u201310 inches thick and that the mix is washed and blended on site. He notes that \u201cmostly everything you see on this course is West Virginian.\u201d We then see #4 green at #4 lake, where Sparky (Keith Sparkman) uses a specialized contouring machine to put the final shape on the green and surrounds. Harris explains that Pete trusts Sparky\u2019s judgment and that he follows Pete from job to job, possibly even being a physician by training.

The right side is a contoured hillside designed to accommodate up to 30,000 spectators, explicitly evoking dreams of hosting major tournaments.\nThe narrator closes by stating that the vision of James LaRosa and the genius of Pete Dye have combined to create a unique opportunity in central West Virginia, and thanks viewers for sharing in the excitement. The final tone is aspirational, positioning the club as both a world-class golf experience and a potential major championship venue.",

On a finished or nearly finished 4th fairway beside the lake, James D. introduces his son James Jay (Jimmy), PB Dye, golf professional Drew Pearson, long-time surveyor Ed Tiefman, and shop operations coordinator John Angotti. Behind them, he points out the 4th green, mounding, the lake, the mine fan, and the hill apex Pete Dye aligned behind the green. Earlier, another group (in casual shirts and polos) poses near a pond and stone wall, while John continues narrating about the tipple, roadbed, and No. 10 tee. Louie steps in front of the camera to joke about never being paid since 1978 and about filming family weddings, while others vouch that he also didn\u2019t charge for those. These scenes humanize the project, showing the LaRosa family, friends, and professional staff proud of the emerging course.",

A roll of fabric paper in the bunker base prevents mud from contaminating the cinders. He explains that seven large bunkers on No. 1 may each require about 20 tons of cinders. Harris Holt steps into the trap to test footing and ball lie, reporting that the cinders are quite soft; James speculates that rain and gravity may compact them over time.
